I have unashamedly neglected this blog since the 28th January 2018, and
 invariably I am a monster.

Here are some things that have happened in my life since I last posted, I:

* got a new job to try working in IT
* learned (some) C++
* sold all of my Apple products and switched to a Google Pixel 3
* moved into a house
* got another new job working in IT
* enjoyed the **shit** out of *Detective Pikachu* (the movie and the DS game)
* forgot to cancel the free Spotify trial that came with my PS4 but stuck with it
* signed up for an unlimited travel card to get discount public transport through work
* (tried to) got over myself
* **had a baby**

Niamh Imogen is 10 weeks old and she is my absolute world. I joked for a while
 that I wouldn't dare bring a child into this world in the state that it's in;
 but at the same time I'm nearly 30 and everything just kind of fell
 into place with the love of my life. I don't think I can change the world or
 save anyone or anything, but I can try to be the best version of myself to
 give her the best possible chance. Plus: now I have someone to look after me
 when I'm in a care home.
