So yeah, I got the job.

## deep end 🌊

After a full week managing I think I can safely say I will never think I know everything in a job role ever again. All internal (*and external*) panicking aside, I bought myself a Moleskine diary and a journal, in a thinly veiled attempt to look organised.

## day planning

I take around twenty minutes per day laying out how I would like my day to go. This is done by writing down every task I can think of in any order. I then mark important tasks with a \*, tasks that **need** doing with a !, tasks that require research with a 🔎 and tasks that can be delegated with →. As the day progresses I can mark tasks started with a ⚫️ and tick off completed items.
