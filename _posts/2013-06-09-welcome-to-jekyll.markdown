So here I am running [Jekyll][jekyll], a Ruby powered flat-blog generating static-site generator.

Jekyll wouldn't be in my normal choices for a blog system as it runs on Ruby, but [GitHub Pages][ghpages] allows you to host and run a Jekyll blog from one of you repositories with very little effort. Sweet!
