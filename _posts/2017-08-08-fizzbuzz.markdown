### I'm trying to learn Apple's Swift programming language the only way I know how to learn a programming language--by smacking a keyboard with my fingers until something works.

I completed A-level Computing back in college which taught me a couple of valuable lessons:

* VB.NET is a cruel mistress, but Stockholm Syndrome has me only remembering the good times

* It's not about being able to program; it's about being able to problem solve

I've seen quite a few people online raving about Swift (particularly the videos Apple uploaded showing everyone from babies to grandparents writing apps in Swift) and had some spare hours between work, sleep, and *Crash Bandicoot*; so I've started to try pick up Swift to see what I can accomplish.

Apple has a fantastic free eBook they keep updated for learning the basics of Swift as well as a website they maintain with a primer as well as a PHP.net style function breakdown. It goes without saying that documentation is king.

## so wtf is fizzbuzz

FizzBuzz is a children's game which some companies use in interviews when hiring programmers.

FizzBuzz is a game where two people take turns reciting numbers from 1-100 (or higher). If a number is a multiple of 3 the person must say "Fizz" instead, if a number is a multiple of 5: "Buzz", and for both "FizzBuzz". For example:

* 1
* 2
* fizz
* 3
* buzz
* fizz
* 7
* 8
* fizz
* buzz
* 11
* fizz
* 13
* 14
* fizzbuzz

Asking a programmer to reproduce this should be a very easy task, but it does also provide a great insight into what style of programmer they are. Do they slap shit together and hope for the best? Or do they actually think of edge cases and future-proofing?

There's tonnes of great resources online on FizzBuzz, including [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc) by Tom Scott on the various methods people use to solve FizzBuzz. My method is below, in Swift.

{% highlight swift %}

for i in 1...100 {
    var output = ""
    if i % 3 == 0 { output += "Fizz" }
    if i % 5 == 0 { output += "Buzz" }
    if output == "" { output = String(i) }
    print(output)
}

{% endhighlight %}

And here's the output:
