Call me a sheep but the world appears to be getting flatter, and I for one welcome the change.

# Something the big three all agree on

Apple, Google, and Microsoft have all taken steps towards flat interfaces with the advent of iOS 7, Android 4.0, and Windows 8 respectively, and they're not the only ones. Twitter/Github's [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), and as such a [claimed 1% of the web, has followed suit](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/28/bootstrap-3-goes-mobile-first-now-reportedly-powers-1-of-the-web/).

Pardon me for bandwagon-ing, but I see the pros for this trend and have tweaked by site **again** to follow, like the wool covered animal I am.

# A few other changes

I've finally fixed the paddings and spacing of the site, so it no longer hurts your eyes to separate the page, and I've now made my desktop and mobile background the header banner, the source is [here](http://wallbase.cc/wallpaper/2901427) as well as in the footer. Oh, and I've removed the webfonts, just because I watched [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il4swGfTOSM) and took it a little to heart.

&lt;3 you all bbiab, Tom.
