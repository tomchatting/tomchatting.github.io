<img src="/static/images/IMG_0054.gif" alt="An animated gif with sketches describing my January">

* picked up an iPad Mini
* drove to Whitby
* got a Field Notes notebook
* sketched like mad
* visited Dublin (for a stag)

We're off to a flyer. **Note to self**: don't blog on the ipad without a keyboard again, it sucks.
