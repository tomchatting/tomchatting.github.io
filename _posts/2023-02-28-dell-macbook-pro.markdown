I've spent some time setting up and configuring macOS Ventura on a rescued Dell Latitude 7280.

I've documented my endeavour, as well as a list of what's working (most of it) on [GitHub](https://github.com/tomchatting/Dell_Latitude_7280_macOS) for anyone with a similar spec machine.

If you don't have a similar spec machine, the art of Hackintosh is probably at its' peak since the Intel Tiger days. These days, however, are probably numbered as the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon nears completion; there's no telling when Apple will pull the plug on support for Intel64 devices.

Maybe by then I'll be able to afford a proper replacement for my now disposed MacBook Air.
