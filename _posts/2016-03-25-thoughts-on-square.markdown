I've started working on SquareCMS again recently after having some time off work, the [GitHub](//github.com/tomchatting/square) is being updated a lot more and there's a working demo [here](//square-shiftysu.rhcloud.com) if you want to have a play.

## so will i go back to running on square?

Probably not, simply because I'm so used to running my blog as a git repo now, and I love GitHub flavoured markdown (which I'm probably going to build a plugin for Square anyway).

## so why do it?

Because I actually want to, and I actually enjoy writing code again.

## so what's to come? (false promises time)

So at the moment I'm focusing on getting the thing working as it was before (over five years ago), but there *is* some stuff I want to work on adding:

* full plugin support (the PDO should help here)
* shit tonnes better documentation
* multi-user support (although I'm not too sure on this one)
* ability to add custom tags without changing a line of code (thinking of how Jekyll handles custom tags in the layout of the `_posts` markdown files)

## when will 2.0 drop it's alpha tag?

Well, it'll go beta when I'm ready, and it'll go final when I'm ready too. So basically don't hold your breath.
