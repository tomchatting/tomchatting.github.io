My friend Matty and I have decided to run a two-player Nuzlocke challenge with Pokemon Diamond and Pearl.

The rules we are using are adapted from a Red and Blue challenge, so the levels may turn out to be a bit difficult, but who doesn't like a challenge?

The first dilemma is our rule-set states you may only have as many *active* Pokemon as your rival had at your last battle, but Nuzlocke rules state you must "catch the first Pokemon in each area and nothing else".

The easiest way around this was to follow the Nuzlocke rules, but box all "inactives" at Gyms and WiFi battles.

My main issue with the system at the moment, at the early stages of the game, is that mine and Matty's teams are *very* similar, due to the fact that early routes are filled with Bidoof and Starly. That being said, I managed to catch a Magikarp while Matty got an Abra, I got a Shinx while he got an Onix, so hopefully our parties will be diverse and fights won't just be pound-offs.

## My Party

*All level 10, inactives in italics*

## Grinding is a real grind

Getting Pokemon to flat levels is a real bore, especially early game when all wild Pokemon do is use Growl and Growth; I would *kill* for an exp share.

## Anyway

I'll be updating the blog with notes on my (and Matty's) progress in the coming days/weeks.
