Hold up: this one could get weird again.

## Shit I've realised:

* I've used a Mac for nearly a year, after being the opposite of an Apple shill for years
* I've used an iPhone for longer. **What is wrong with me?**
* The real way to format lists is as follows: {% highlight css startinline=true %}
ul, ol, dl {
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
  padding-left: 40px;
}
li {
  margin-bottom: 0.25rem;
}
{% endhighlight %}
* I'm twenty four in less than four months
* I probably wouldn't survive the Commonwealth as long as I have in Fallout 4
* The font/size for optimal reading on the web is up for debate, but `18px/1.5 sans-serif` seems like a fairly good bet
* Pagination should run from Newest-Oldest/Left-Right, because if it were page numbers it'd go 1-x; also western=left-right writing
* Making lists is an easy way to fill a blog post

Merry Holiday, I'll write again next year* (\*maybe)
