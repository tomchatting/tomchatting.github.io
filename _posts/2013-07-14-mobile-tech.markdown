## When your phone is more powerful than your laptop ##

I have two notebooks in my possession for "couch computing" and writing assignments when AFBC (away from behemoth computer). Their specs are rather modest, even for their generations. The larger of the two is a 2007 model 15" HP laptop sporting an AMD64 2.2GHz Dual Core processor, 2GB RAM and integrated Nvidia graphics with a max resolution of 1280x768, the smaller being a 7" Asus Eee PC sporting a 0.9GHz Intel 32-bit single core Celeron processor and a whopping 1GB RAM, with Intel "accelerated" graphics pumping out an impressively crisp 1024x600px resolution. Both these devices are over 5 years old, but let's look at phones from 5 years ago: the HTC G1 had a 320x480 pixel display, a 0.528GHz processor (single core) and 192MB RAM, about comparable with computers at the turn of the *millennium* (although "gaming rigs" may have sported Intel Tualatin's clocking 1.2GHz). Flash forward and  my Nexus 4 today has a **quad core** 1.51 GHz Snapdragon, 2GB RAM and a Qualcomm Adreno pumping  out 768x1184 pixels. 

## The point/Tl;dr ##

When mid-high range phones have caught up to low-mid range computers from just 5-6 years ago, when 5-6 years ago, they were nearly 10 years behind, you know the future of mobile tech is going to be awesome. (*Also, Moore's law*)
