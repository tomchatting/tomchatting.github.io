As I alluded to in a previous rant, I have the unnatural talent of allowing myself into slumping. By this I mean I can be quite content in the art of settling. I’m coming up to the two-year mark at *big red bank*, and until very recently I was reaching a similar position I was in this time last year: complacency.

In my last month’s career conversation my manager hit the nail on the head; I am happy to silently pay my dues, get on with the work and take no recognition for it. I hit >90% of my performance indicators, I cause little to no drama and I don’t like to draw any attention to myself. She continued that she fears I will become bored in my role, so she offered I become an SME in a new focus for the bank: digital opportunities, in order to give me something new to do. Alongside this she suggested I keep an open mind about “progression”, to which I agreed. Later that day I applied for a manager job. Not even four days later I’m told I have a preliminary interview on Monday.

I don’t necessarily think I’ll even pass the prelim stage, hell I’m surprised my <cite>written in thirty minutes oh Dog I sent it before even proof-reading it</cite> cover letter even got me this far; but so far my Saturday has been spent swatting up on policies and procedures a manager undertakes ready for a roleplay and a presentation. Oh boy.

## so what else is new?

I bought myself a Ducky One keyboard, partly because I quite fancy taking up writing (be it notes, blogs, reviews, stories I’ll never publish) and the Ducky is renowned for being a delight to type on—which it is—but also because CLACK CLACK. The sound of a fully mechanical, cherry switched keyboard is just downright… pleasurable to type on (see attached YouTube video for evidence).

After a few months of owning a PS4 and a PS Vita I’ve established a fairly healthy amount of games to play through. I recently completed played through *Uncharted 4, Until Dawn, Ratchet and Clank, Rogue Warrior, Hyper Light Drifter, NBA 2k16* and *The Last of Us*, thanks to PlayStation Plus however, the list doesn’t go down at any scary speed. I still have *Dragon Age, Uncharted: Golden Abyss, Gravity Falls, Life is Strange* and *Persona 4* to chug through, I might even hit this shit up with some notes or a review about them. All the while I’m mid-Gold on *League of Legends*, though with the shake up in the ranked queue system I really don’t know if I can get carried to Platinum again like last season, but y’know.

## so what’s the plan?

Lawyer up, hit the gym, delete Facebook. Seriously though I have no idea, *voice in my head*, I can see myself going in a few different directions and to be honest I kind of like the idea of all of them. Hopefully I learn enough from failing my assessment on Monday to get a shoe onto the ladder, if not: I have things lined up still, I’m happy enough where I am, albeit I would love to move out (big up the rental market); but that takes money. Money I keep spending on Ducky keyboards and every games console going. Adulting is easy, right?

And oh yeah, *Pokémon Go* is a thing.
