	<h1 class="article-title">hello, world!</h1>

<p>My name’s Tom, and I’m a 25 year old working at one of the UK’s biggest banks.</p>

<h2 id="tom">tom</h2>

<p>My earliest computer memory was of my family DOS box but I can’t remember much of that. The first family PC I remember was a custom OEM built Windows 98SE box in coral blue, which we had from when I was about 7 up until just before high school when we upgraded the machine and stuck with Windows XP until I got my own laptop running Windows Vista. Since then, I’ve just built my own PCs but sometimes you can see me hipstering out with my MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Phone wise I’ve gone from an Android G1 to an iPhone and back… then back again. I currently rock an iPhone 7, like the filthy hypocrite I am.</p>
