Apple has revised and retuned it’s glorified giant iPod touch time and time again, and now—fully indoctrined into the ways of Apple—I’ve jumped into the fray. But can this device truly hit the mark as a “Pro” device?</h2>

<hr />

<p>I’ve been using the new iPad Pro as my daily driver for just over 48 hours now, but I don’t feel like I’m using an iPad—and I think that’s Apple’s intention.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/sQB2NjhJHvY">iPad Pro — What’s a computer — Apple</a></p>

<p>Whilst I don’t see myself being so… forceful with this over £600 piece of equipment (though I’ve totally nailed the fold slam trick) I can completely understand Apple’s logic on the direction they’ve taken with their Pro device. The iPad is for people who want a couch computer, a device they can watch YouTube and browse the web on. The Pro takes that concept and blurs the line further between itself and a laptop. The Pro sports Apple’s new custom built A10X chip, which drives a beautiful Retina display and up to 120Hz refresh rates (which seems to be supported on everything from <em>Hearthstone</em> to the Home Screen). The result of this is a snappy, gorgeous machine which feels as premium as its’ cost demands. Of course, this is only half the story. In previous iterations of iPad, the device has only been as good as the giant iPhone software it’s running. Enter iOS 11.</p>

<h2 id="macos-meets-ios-meets-macos">macos meets ios meets macos</h2>
<p>Users of the Mac will know that over the past couple of versions of the OS, the gap between iOS and MacOS has been shrinking (hello Siri). I almost consider Yosemite the practice-version of what would become iOS 11 with it’s Windows 7 snap-style take on multitasking and it’s obsession with full screen. I will admit on the 13” MacBook Pro, and indeed on larger screens, full screen computing frustrates me; I do consider myself a “Windows” user (in the sense that I like to have lots going on with my screen at once),  but the iPad, with iOS 11, finally obliges my hardstuck ways.</p>

<p>The new operating system feels fluid and intuitive, and apps snap freely between iPad versions (in 50-100% size) and iPhone versions (at less than 50% size), leaving you able to do crazy things, like watching a YouTube video and reading BBC News at the same time. 2017 is crazy.</p>

<h2 id="accessories-are-power">accessories are power</h2>
<p>The iPad Pro carries much more than a shiny OS and multitasking, it is also backed by exclusive accessories. One of said accessories makes complete sense to me and I feel should be included with the device. The other is a £99 stylus.</p>

<p>The iPad Pro Smart Keyboard is small, discreet, and doubles as a stand for when you don’t want to type and just want to watch/play. The key travel is shallow and does take getting used it, but it carries a tactile feel and I’ve been able to get up to full-speed typing within a few hours of using it. The keyboard supports all the usual array of shortcuts fresh from the Mac, including <code class="highlighter-rouge">cmd+tab</code> (iOS now sports a cute task switched) and <code class="highlighter-rouge">cmd+h</code> to go to the home screen. Where the struggle begins is more to do with what I’m used to. I’m missing my 7” slab of glass underneath the space bar that lets me point to things on my screen<sup><a href="#footnotes/pointing">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The Apple Pencil is difficult. In theory I feel like it makes complete sense. The pencil is to the iPad Pro what the Smart Keyboard is to the iPad Pro. One lets you write away and pro-user-shortcut your way around the device, and seems the perfect match for writers; the other is a pencil. And I guess the pencil carries with it the ability to draw, and point with greater accuracy, or colour, or stencil, or whatever, but for me it’s come as an expensive “also this”. I’m not saying there’s anything inherently <em>wrong</em> with the thing—it feels weighted in your hand and is precise <em>af</em>—rather, it just doesn’t feel like it holds a true… use for me. I have, however, still found myself reaching for it instead of pointing with my finger whilst using the Smart Keyboard, as it bridges the gap quite nicely and leaves me not having to lean in to point.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DnGmAzf.jpg" alt="iPad with Pencil and Smart Keyboard" /></p>

<h2 id="so-who-is-this-for">so who is this for?</h2>
<p>The iPad Pro sits on the forefront of what can only be described as a two-pronged niche. On one hand are the professionals who needs a solid, reliable, tablet to draw on or write with. iOS has really matured over the years and the operating system can finally comfortably support a power user with their “lighter” tasks, and almost all apps from the App Store support some kind of hand off to a fully fledged power app on the Mac proper. On the other hand, the iPad Pro sits in a rather new market; the “Pro Consumer”. Some people (particularly me… and probably other nerds) need a device that is light enough and good enough to run YouTube, Music, and a couple of games without choking; but also heavy-duty enough to keep up, multitask, and carry through an entire day without a charge<sup><a href="#footnotes/battery-life">2</a></sup>. I think Apple has truly reimagined what the word “Pro” means in it’s Pro line, and I don’t think it’s short for Professional anymore.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2>
<p>The iPad Pro presents itself as a Microsoft Surface killer, but I think Apple missed the mark there. What I really see the iPad Pro as is a MacBook Air killer. This device is exactly what I wanted in Uni, and to be honest it fits my niche quite well. If you’re anything like me and you need a “Pro by 2017’s Pro” device, I’d recommend buying the shit outta this device. For anyone else, I think a trip to the Apple Store to just have a play with the thing would soon swing you into the former category.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nt9kry8.jpg" alt="iPad with Tom" />
(“What’s a computer?” — Whilst I find it completely obnoxious when taken literally, I totally get where the marketing department was coming from with that line… sorry)</p>
<hr />
<p><a name="footnotes/pointing">1</a>: The touch screen on the iPad is incredibly responsive, 20ms to be precise, however there is a learning curve for keyboard and mouse diehards such as myself to learn to reach out and touch rather than using a secondary device.</p>

<p><a name="footnotes/battery-life">2</a>: Apple has claimed 10 hours on devices before and been very, very wrong (and have stung me for that, thanks man). So far the iPad Pro seems to live true to the 10 hour claim, though I’d be silly to bet against that changing after more battery cycles.</p>

<h3 id="im-trying-to-learn-apples-swift-programming-language-the-only-way-i-know-how-to-learn-a-programming-languageby-smacking-a-keyboard-with-my-fingers-until-something-works">I’m trying to learn Apple’s Swift programming language the only way I know how to learn a programming language–by smacking a keyboard with my fingers until something works.</h3>

<hr />

<p>I completed A-level Computing back in college which taught me a couple of valuable lessons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>VB.NET is a cruel mistress, but Stockholm Syndrome has me only remembering the good times</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s not about being able to program; it’s about being able to problem solve</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve seen quite a few people online raving about Swift (particularly the videos Apple uploaded showing everyone from babies to grandparents writing apps in Swift) and had some spare hours between work, sleep, and <em>Crash Bandicoot</em>; so I’ve started to try pick up Swift to see what I can accomplish.</p>

<p>Apple has a fantastic free eBook they keep updated for learning the basics of Swift as well as a website they maintain with a primer as well as a PHP.net style function breakdown. It goes without saying that documentation is king.</p>

<h2 id="so-wtf-is-fizzbuzz">so wtf is fizzbuzz</h2>

<p>FizzBuzz is a children’s game which some companies use in interviews when hiring programmers.</p>

<p>FizzBuzz is a game where two people take turns reciting numbers from 1-100 (or higher). If a number is a multiple of 3 the person must say “Fizz” instead, if a number is a multiple of 5: “Buzz”, and for both “FizzBuzz”. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1</li>
  <li>2</li>
  <li>fizz</li>
  <li>3</li>
  <li>buzz</li>
  <li>fizz</li>
  <li>7</li>
  <li>8</li>
  <li>fizz</li>
  <li>buzz</li>
  <li>11</li>
  <li>fizz</li>
  <li>13</li>
  <li>14</li>
  <li>fizzbuzz</li>
</ul>

<p>Asking a programmer to reproduce this should be a very easy task, but it does also provide a great insight into what style of programmer they are. Do they slap shit together and hope for the best? Or do they actually think of edge cases and future-proofing?</p>

<p>There’s tonnes of great resources online on FizzBuzz, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc">this video</a> by Tom Scott on the various methods people use to solve FizzBuzz. My method is below, in Swift.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="mi">100</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="k">var</span> <span class="nv">output</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">""</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">output</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="s">"Fizz"</span> <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">output</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="s">"Buzz"</span> <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">output</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And here’s the output:</p>

There’s been a few times this year I’ve half-started a post and then just kind of left it–and that’s okay! Here’s some of my accomplishments so far this year. (<em>Suck it, 2017</em>)</h3>

<hr />

<p>Time flies.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the year <a href="/2017/01/01/my-annual-year">I looked back at 2016</a> and took stock on what had been happening so far (TL;DR: time moves pretty quick). Flash forward to July and I’ve realised I have neglected this blog. I also realised that doesn’t really matter.</p>

<h2 id="reflection-is-a-powerful-tool">reflection is a powerful tool</h2>

<p>In January I took a lot of time reflecting before writing my post, this was a very powerful thing to do. For one: it put a lot of things into perspective; huge problems seemed tiny in hindsight, secondly, it allowed me to put a lot of what I’d done into words–and that had a really huge impact. Sometimes accomplishments are drowned out by the problems of the time, problems that seem insignificant in the long run.</p>

<p>2017 has been a very good year so far. Don’t get me wrong, there’s been the usual fair share of good days and shit days, but I’m finally starting to maintain a sense of purpose through it all (25 years late, mind).</p>

<h2 id="i-am-still-in-love-with-snapchat">i am still in love with snapchat</h2>

<p>I mentioned last time that I had managed to shake my perpetual social network anxiety, scrolling back through Photos.app shows that hasn’t changed. This has the benefit of me being able to take small amounts of time just scroll through my photos and reminisce over when stuff goes right.</p>

<h2 id="promises-promises">promises promises</h2>

<p>Gonna try to update this blog a little more regularly for the rest of the year. I also want to have a go at a video of some kind (waiting on Josh to let me use his drone). Also, I got an Apple Watch… I’m sorry.</p>

    <h1><a href=/ramble/2017/01/01/my-annual-year/>my annual year 📖</a></h1>
    <time datetime='2017-01-01'>01 Jan 2017</time>
<iframe width="700" height="394" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Lm-rpaWkONI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="0"> </iframe>

<p>I sit on a new bed in the same room wearing my second ever pair of joggers typing on a new MacBook Pro after drinking a bottle of Cava to myself. But how did I get here? In <em>The Onion</em> fashion, this is: “<strong>my annual year</strong>”.</p>

<hr />

<p>In <a href="/2015/11/16/time-passes">November 2015</a> I reflected on the life I was living, and alluded to a discontent in <em>how</em> I was living said life:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe I’ll
fall into the same slump as before (again even if only slightly), or maybe I’ll
manage just enough of a change to nudge myself into another New Tom. Future Tom.
 I hope he looks back at this release and cringes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I’m looking back and I’m not cringing. This self-reflection really put gears in motion in my mind to produce what has become one of my favourite years alive so far.</p>

<h2 id="2016-the-year-of-did-i-do-that">2016: the year of “did <em>I</em> do that?”</h2>

<p>My greatest accomplishment in 2016 stood on the shoulders of my second-greatest: I became a manager at <em>big red</em>. I was voted “People’s Choice” for best Customer Service Team Leader/Adviser. Now, I’m not the work obsessed gremlin ranking such an achievement would suggest, but it was the moment I accepted what I meant to others. I saw my best friend cry as I took the prize and felt like I’d really done them proud, in fact, I’d done <em>myself</em> proud.</p>

<h2 id="my-biggest-change-i-lost-my-socialnetworkanxiety">my biggest change: I lost my social(<em>network</em>)anxiety</h2>

<p><img src="http://s23.postimg.org/b8n1j2msb/IMG_0194.jpg" alt="london trip photo" width="200px" style="float:left; padding-right: 10px;" /></p>

<p>2016 was the first year I actually enjoyed public social networks. From Twitter to SnapChat and Instagram and back I actually enjoyed sharing my life on social networks. Actually, no, I wasn’t hung up on exactly what I was sharing anymore because I was just sharing snippets of my life. I think that’s kinda the point though, so go me for finally getting it?</p>

<p>I just spent 20 minutes or so reviewing Photos on the MacBook (which, by the way, is fucking seamless) and it reminded me of how much I’ve actually done this year, and more surprisingly, how much I’ve actually documented. Fuck, I’ve even taken <em>selfies</em>.</p>

<h2 id="speaking-of-selfies">speaking of selfies…</h2>

<p><img src="https://s23.postimg.org/hnm2fqti3/IMG_0289.jpg" alt="selfie" width="200px" style="float:right; padding-left: 10px;" /></p>

<p>I seemed to finally, after 24 years, crack the answer to the age-old question of “how do you want it?” when going to the barbers. In doing that (and after receiving at least <em>one</em> compliment) I’ve found myself taking much more pictures of my face. Until tonight I really didn’t appreciate how useful that actually is, as it’s enabled me to take stock on a lot of positives this year (<em>right: German Christmas market with Alex</em>). On a serious note, it’s really shown how much my confidence has improved this year on the whole–for one I’m now leading a team of 12 people which requires a lot of public speaking, which I’m unashamedly loving!</p>

<h2 id="other-memories-in-no-particular-order">other memories (in no particular order)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>traded in the MacBook Air for a 2016 MacBook Pro (review coming soon?)</li>
  <li>spent annual leave away from home - <strong>alone</strong>!</li>
  <li>travelled to London for a spontaneous day</li>
  <li><em>Uncharted 4</em></li>
  <li>felt financial stability</li>
  <li>reached 10 stone, officially making me a “healthy weight” for my height</li>
</ul>
