<p>It‚Äôs been three months since my last blog post, so I thought I‚Äôd post some updates on my life <sup>and excuses for not posting</sup>.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Fbqgtaz.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="what-is-life">What is life</h2>

<ul>
  <li>As of October 29th, I am an official (temporary) employee at a leading supermarket chain (hence the corporate banner colour)</li>
  <li>I hit Gold II at my peak in League of Legends (I‚Äôm currently Gold III due to sucking pretty hard, but I‚Äôm quite pleased with my progress. Next up: Platinum!)</li>
  <li>Third year at University has forced me to hit the ground running, and that‚Äôs been pretty tough so far. But so far, so good.</li>
  <li>I <em>still</em> haven‚Äôt got the new Facebook experience</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="coming-up">Coming up</h2>

<p>In the pipe for the blog: some more bigoted, elitist, views on my climb through the ranks in League (and why how self deprecating I am IRL has helped), some Chemistry/Pharmacy stuff (good excuse for revision), and some more random YouTube embeds from music I think you should listen to‚Äìbecause my taste in music is the <em>correct</em> taste in music.</p>

<p>Ttyl; bbiab,</p>

    <h1><a href=/note/2013/08/09/google-play-music-all-access/>Google Play Music All Access: terrible title, terrific service</a></h1>

<p><a href="https://play.google.com/about/music/">Google Play Music All Access</a> may well hold the title for being the worst named product in Google history, but for ¬£7.99 a month with a 30 day free trial it may also well be the best-value product in Google history.</p>

<p>Plugging straight into the app on your Android device, the service turns your device into an all-containing jukebox. Songs and albums can be played on a one off basis or added to your library (or device offline) at the press of a button. The service is also available for use via Google‚Äôs web ‚Äúapp‚Äù on desktops and Chrome devices.</p>

<p>The Radio feature works much like Spotify Radio or Pandora, and is so far proving to be a great music discovery method, with the added benefit of being able to download a local copy of any song you like in case you go through a tunnel or land in North Korea.</p>

<p>Speaking of North Korea, there‚Äôs some great documentaries on visiting the hermit nation by <a href="http://www.vice.com/the-vice-guide-to-travel/vice-guide-to-north-korea-1-of-3">Vice on YouTube</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href=/note/2013/08/06/the-plan-has-failed/>Abort the mission, I've fallen in love with Jekyll</a></h1>
    <time datetime='2013-08-06'>06 Aug 2013</time>
<iframe width="640" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/PF-_H54mydE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="1"> </iframe>

<p>When I initially did the setup routine and migrated my previous blog to Jekyll, I saw it as a temporary thing while I redeveloped my bespoke blog engine ‚ÄúSquareCMS‚Äù. What I didn‚Äôt anticipate was falling in love with the workflow of, developing for, and writing with <a href="//jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<h2 id="a-geeks-platform">A geeks platform</h2>

<p>Also known as a ‚Äúhackers‚Äù platform, Jekyll really is designed to be tinkered and messed with. Unlike with SquareCMS, I have an easily tinkered with testing environment (my home PC running Ruby) that is (most unlike PHP/MySQL development) easily synced with the running‚Äì‚Äú<em>live</em>‚Äù‚Äìenvironment.</p>

<h2 id="unless-you-need-extra-features-generated-flat-files-are-fine">Unless you need extra features, generated flat files are fine</h2>

<p>‚ÄúCompiled‚Äù in around a second or so on my machine, and uploaded in less than a minute, my entire site is now a group of flat, procedurally generated files. Think about it: do you <em>really</em> need a server-side computer generating the same page for every visitor <strong>every</strong> time they visit? Not especially. I don‚Äôt need plugins, multiple authors, server side management, search; I just need a quick-to-use, quick-to-post-to, easy-to-tinker site, and Jekyll provides it.</p>

<p>Abort the mission, I‚Äôve fallen in love with Jekyll.</p>

<p>Changing the source of the stylesheet gives me a great excuse to push a post at the same time.</p>
