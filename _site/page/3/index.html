    <time datetime='2016-02-23'>23 Feb 2016</time>
<p>One lesson all uni students should have in their schedules every year is a
lecture from the librarian of their school. In my case that was a recently
graduated Humanities student (because who else would be the Sciences librarian?)
who would give us the same talk every year on the importance of referencing.</p>

<p>Though boring as hell, I didn’t realise how lucky I was to receive something like
this so consistently during my years at uni; it was only after I discovered
my sister was never taught to reference.</p>

<h1 id="turn-it-in-and-you-and-the-devil-too">turn it in and you (and the devil, too!)</h1>

<p>All universities in this day and age use some sort of plagiarism ‘detecting’
tool such as turnitin to sort the cheats from the heroes. Most of these
are terrible, terrible pieces of pseudo-ware which simply plug your work
through Google et al to try and work out if you just copy-pasted Wikipedia.</p>

<p>To combat this, the primary school child in you will automatically begin
rewriting what you are copying into your own words, but this is where the basic
rule of academic writing steps in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if you write anything which cannot be considered your own thought or idea, it <strong>must</strong> be referenced (Chatting, 2016)</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="building-references">building references</h1>

<p>Wherever possible, you should compile a list of the sources you use for each
page of your writing (<em>just stick it in the footer</em>) so you can go back once
it’s finished so you can build your bibliography (which I’ll touch on later).</p>

<p>For books, grab the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>author’s name(s)</li>
  <li>year of publication</li>
  <li>book title</li>
  <li>edition (if not the 1st)</li>
  <li>city of publication</li>
  <li>publisher</li>
</ul>

<p>For journal articles, you’ll need the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>author’s name(s)</li>
  <li>year the journal was published</li>
  <li>title of the article</li>
  <li>title of the journal</li>
  <li>the page number or range of pages of the article</li>
  <li>volume and issue numbers where you can provide them</li>
</ul>

<p>For ‘electronic resources’, try to get the above plus the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>date you accessed the sources</li>
  <li>the URL or email</li>
  <li>type of resource (email, forum, website, etc)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="quotes-vs-interpretation">quotes vs interpretation</h1>

<p>If you ever use the idea of another person or quote someone (which you should
keep to a bare minimum) you should be looking to add a reference. You can get
away with not using a reference <strong>only</strong> when the information can be considered
public domain, for example stating that the 6’o’clock News generally airs at 6pm.</p>

<h2 id="direct-quotes">direct quotes</h2>

<p>If you ever copy what an author says word-for-word, use inverted commas or
double inverted commas to wrap the phrase and follow it immediately with your
reference. Do not modify the sentence in anyway, leaving mistakes as they are.
You can correct any errors and show your reader you recognise them by using <em>(sic)</em>.</p>

<h2 id="referencing-interpretation">referencing interpretation</h2>

<p>This is how you should be completing the majority of your academic writing, as
it is a true display of your understanding of a topic. You must still reference
the ideas, and this is done by quoting the author’s surname and the year of
publication in brackets.</p>

<h1 id="referencing-the-actual-way-to-do-it">referencing (the actual way to do it)</h1>

<p>Harvard referencing can be broken down into two parts: the article’s body, and
the reference list.</p>

<p>The article body points at the reference list using the author’s surname and
date, which is then displayed in full with the source used in the reference
list, for example if I were to say: referencing is a fking ballache.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chatting (2016) suggests referencing is a tedious process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Summarises the gist of what I said, whereas a direct quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chatting (2016) stated ‘referencing is a fking(sic) ballache’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Referencing a journal or book might look like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>F. D. Martinez, 2007. “Genes, environments, development and asthma: a reappraisal” doi: 10.1183/​09031936.00087906ERJ January 1, 2007 vol. 29 1 179-184</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While referencing this website may look like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chatting, T (2016) ‘quick and dirty referencing’, <em>tom</em> [Online], Available: <a href="http://tomchatting.github.io/article/2016/02/23/quick-and-dirty-referencing.html">http://tomchatting.github.io/article/2016/02/23/quick-and-dirty-referencing.html</a> [23 Feb 2016]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your reference list should be organised in alphabetical order (by author’s surname)
or in logical order (the order in which you referenced them in the body).</p>

<h2 id="let-your-references-run-free">let your references run free</h2>

<p>The tl;dr of all this is please reference or you will fail/have an academic
integrity review and that will be a bad thing. There is no ‘good’ number of
references to aim for, but there is no such thing as too many references.</p>

<p>Layout and some examples taken from the University of Exeter’s Study Skills guide
to referencing found <a href="https://education.exeter.ac.uk/dll/studyskills/harvard_referencing.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>A fantastic tool for creating reference guides/bibliographies is <a href="http://www.neilstoolbox.com/bibliography-creator/">Neil’s Toolbox</a>, to which I would
like to credit my entire degree.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’ve used a Mac for nearly a year, after being the opposite of an Apple shill for years</li>
  <li>I’ve used an iPhone for longer. <strong>What is wrong with me?</strong></li>
  <li>The real way to format lists is as follows:</li>
</ul>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nt">ul</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">ol</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">dl</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="nl">margin-bottom</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">0.25rem</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>I’m twenty four in less than four months</li>
  <li>I probably wouldn’t survive the Commonwealth as long as I have in Fallout 4</li>
  <li>The font/size for optimal reading on the web is up for debate, but <code class="highlighter-rouge">18px/1.5 sans-serif</code> seems like a fairly good bet</li>
  <li>Pagination should run from Newest-Oldest/Left-Right, because if it were page numbers it’d go 1-x; also western=left-right writing</li>
  <li>Making lists is an easy way to fill a blog post</li>
</ul>

<p>Merry Holiday, I’ll write again next year* (*maybe)</p>

<p><img src="http://zippy.gfycat.com/CalculatingApprehensiveAtlanticridleyturtle.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>But this isn’t art, it’s a release. Or is a release a kind of art?</p>

<p>Since May, I can’t think of a massive amount in my life that has changed, but a
lot of minor things can be reeled off the top of my head which I think add up
to a fairly huge change.</p>

<h2 id="i-now-own-my-first-and-only-pair-of-tracksuit-bottoms">I now own my first and only pair of tracksuit bottoms</h2>

<p>I’ve left the phase of my life where I’d revolve around the PC: bed, PC; work,
PC; home, PC; eat, PC; bed.</p>

<p>In a quest to free myself from the chair and desk, I bought a MacBook Air and a
Kindle; using the money from an accolade at work to fund several books. I burned
 through the books and used the MacBook as an ASMR machine. I bought loose
fitting tracksuit bottoms and plain-cotton tees. I wrote a lot of letters to
people which I’d never deliver. I culled my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/tomchatting/playlist/06BE3SX9j3lDJVSdaHCgRh">Spotify playlist</a> and started
again. But I always find a way to relapse, even if slightly. I write this post
after a week of computer-slump. I have neglected the MacBook, left the Kindle
in deep sleep, and reverted my Spotify playlist. Maybe people can’t change.</p>

<p>I remember when I once idolised a friend (and part-time lover), and I could
never understand their obsession with ‘making a change’, pledging every other
month that they’d finally break their mould and get a full-time lover, a
fulfilling job, move out of the house. It seemingly never happened, until the
proactivity from a new interest ended up in everything falling into place.
They’re getting married now, fuck, even having a kid; and yet here I lay, still
pledging to not committing until I’m ready, still ultimately alone.</p>

<h2 id="dont-take-for-granted-one-you-can-confide-in-because-once-theyre-gone-theres-no-lonelier-place">Don’t take for granted one you can confide in, because once they’re gone there’s no lonelier place</h2>

<p>Although I count myself lucky enough to have three close (<em>best</em>) friends, I
find myself no longer having someone I can tell <em>everything</em>. My idol was the
one I would share everything with, and they reciprocated. Although at the time
it felt very natural and familiar, now they’re gone there’s a crippling
loneliness that could almost be mistaken for sadness. But it’s not: it’s real
life.</p>

<h2 id="ultimately-i-may-have-inadvertently-done-a-lot-of-growing-up-over-the-past-12-months">Ultimately I may have inadvertently done a lot of growing up over the past 12 months</h2>

<p>It’s my 12 months anniversary of starting my job at <code class="highlighter-rouge">Big Red Bank</code>. I’ve
never missed a day, I’ve never been later than 30 minutes early. Head down,
full-charge. Every. Damn. Day. I look back at myself 12 months ago and see
a much shyer, reclusive young man. Working at a call centre has a very important
 early lesson: talk spreads. That includes information about myself. Some people
 embrace me, others do not. But ultimately the difference between now Tom and
then Tom is: I simply don’t care.</p>

<p>So where does this leave the next 12 months? I still have short-term goals. But
I’m looking much more long-term than I ever have before. I want to learn more
culture, I want to develop my vocabulary, I want to try new food. Maybe I’ll
fall into the same slump as before (again even if only slightly), or maybe I’ll
manage just enough of a change to nudge myself into another New Tom. Future Tom.
 I hope he looks back at this release and cringes.</p>

    <time datetime='2015-05-03'>03 May 2015</time>
<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/59824094&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<p>Ah Season 2015, smiting champions, Cinderhulk, super-mega-special-super-special-awesome Baron buff, Dragon stacks and <em>crazy ass</em> support builds. Let’s jump in head first!</p>

<h3 id="just-buy-this-and-win">Just buy this and win</h3>

<blockquote>
  <h3 id="righteous-glory-2500g">Righteous Glory 2500g</h3>
  <p>UNIQUE ACTIVE: Grants +60% Movement Speed to you and nearby allies when moving towards enemies for 3 seconds. When this speed boost ends, it emits a shockwave, slowing nearby enemy champions by 80% for one second. 60 second cooldown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will legitimately be shocked if Righteous Glory goes without a nerf or three before the seasons end; it gives champions with normally zero chase-engage (Annie, Morgana) a Shurelya’s Reverie (or Talisman or Ascension) combined with a Randuin’s Omen. Hell, once you’ve finished it, you might as well take a Talisman and a Randuin’s anyway and just stack that sucker up!</p>

<h3 id="theres-building-boots-and-buying-a-ward-on-first-back-and-theres-an-incorrect-back">There’s building boots and buying a ward on first back and there’s an incorrect back</h3>

<p>Roaming and edging advantages means more than ever this season, games are incredibly hard to close out when even with tower buffs, the easiest way to do this is the roam for ward placement/cheeky ganks on mid. Or you know… do it at level one.</p>

<h3 id="what-the-fuck-is-that-build">“What the fuck is that build…”</h3>

<p>Zero AP Annie/Morgana sounds like trash, but support this season isn’t about carrying with damage, it’s about carrying with <a href="http://matchhistory.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/EUW1/2092496922/36795625?tab=stats">utility</a>.</p>
