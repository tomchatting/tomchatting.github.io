A year later, he sandwiched the 15‚Äù machine in between 12‚Äù and 17‚Äù counterparts. 13 years later, I bought a 12‚Äù PowerBook G4. Why? How? What? And, most importantly, why?</h2>

<hr />

<p>As a kid I hated Apple products. Actually, let me be honest, I hated rich people. Apple products seemed to be unnecessarily expensive to myself and, although I would watch the Keynotes and very much want the products on offer, I resented the products for never being able to afford them.
Flash forward to 2014, I got a full time job. With a full time job came an income, with an income came spending. At first: an iPhone; then came an iPad, eventually I moved onto a MacBook Air, then a MacBook Pro, an Apple Watch and finally the AirPods. I am fully indoctrinated into the Church of Jobs. I fucking love it.</p>

<p>My biggest issue when completing any task is procrastination. Essay? Xbox. Research? League of Legends. I find that if I can do something else, I generally will, this blog was actually once of my procrastinatory efforts throughout education. Therein lies the problem. My work rarely requires me to take anything home, which means I no longer need to procrastinate anything beyond laundry or cooking or food shopping, all tasks which (for now) have a novelty and an allure. This means (probably noticeably) this blog has been neglected, as have my other previously procrastination driven hobbies such as PC gaming and programming. What this means is when I do actually want to complete tasks like OC gaming or programming or writing for this blog; I procrastinate it. We‚Äôve reached meta-crastination, people.</p>

<p>What the rant above is trying to justify is my need for a device I can complete a single task on at a time with, that cannot be used for anything beyond basic writing/browsing, in some sort of attempt to force myself to write and code.
I flirted with the idea of returning to the OG Google Chromebook (link to review here), however the forced-always-up-to-date software had driven it beyond the point of no return for obsolescence. The ‚Äúonly-web‚Äù system had fallen to the web, JavaScript and multi-meg pages had finally surpassed the already-close-to limitations Atom processor. So I decided to go deeper‚Äìmore vintage, more abandoned. Enter the PowerBook G4.</p>

<p>With 768 MB of RAM and a 1 GHz PowerPC G4 processor, the PowerBook G4 was just what I needed for single-tasking computing that cannot take me beyond the means of word processing and 2006-era web browsing. Armed with a copy of iWork 2006 and the Internet Radio (college radio at that) of iTunes 10.5.6‚Äìwhich not only still works, but works better than iTunes for Windows ever have/will/could‚ÄìI‚Äôve been able to return to writing and coding.</p>

<h2 id="but-tom-dont-you-have-an-ipad-pro-a-macbook-pro-and-several-notebooks-for-all-this-shit">but tom, don‚Äôt you have an ipad pro, a macbook pro, and several notebooks for all this shit?</h2>

<p>Yes, yes I do. But this thing cost me ¬£50 and I fucking love it. After nearly breaking the damn thing to upgrade the 4200 RPM/40 GB stock HDD to a 5600 RPM/160 GB HDD and loading a fresh eBay copy of Leopard onto the thing, I‚Äôm finding myself able to sit with the PowerBook on a coffee table whilst I bash out some writing. The MbPro still gets love when I need to do some light gaming or actual productive coding, and the iPad Pro is now a work device I use for one to ones and documenting coaching. The PowerBook has well and truly found a niche in my tech-life.</p>

   <title>ipad pro: the least ipad ipad yet üíª</title>

Apple has revised and retuned it‚Äôs glorified giant iPod touch time and time again, and now‚Äîfully indoctrined into the ways of Apple‚ÄîI‚Äôve jumped into the fray. But can this device truly hit the mark as a ‚ÄúPro‚Äù device?</h2>

<hr />

<p>I‚Äôve been using the new iPad Pro as my daily driver for just over 48 hours now, but I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm using an iPad‚Äîand I think that‚Äôs Apple‚Äôs intention.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/sQB2NjhJHvY">iPad Pro ‚Äî What‚Äôs a computer ‚Äî Apple</a></p>

<p>Whilst I don‚Äôt see myself being so‚Ä¶ forceful with this over ¬£600 piece of equipment (though I‚Äôve totally nailed the fold slam trick) I can completely understand Apple‚Äôs logic on the direction they‚Äôve taken with their Pro device. The iPad is for people who want a couch computer, a device they can watch YouTube and browse the web on. The Pro takes that concept and blurs the line further between itself and a laptop. The Pro sports Apple‚Äôs new custom built A10X chip, which drives a beautiful Retina display and up to 120Hz refresh rates (which seems to be supported on everything from <em>Hearthstone</em> to the Home Screen). The result of this is a snappy, gorgeous machine which feels as premium as its‚Äô cost demands. Of course, this is only half the story. In previous iterations of iPad, the device has only been as good as the giant iPhone software it‚Äôs running. Enter iOS 11.</p>

<h2 id="macos-meets-ios-meets-macos">macos meets ios meets macos</h2>
<p>Users of the Mac will know that over the past couple of versions of the OS, the gap between iOS and MacOS has been shrinking (hello Siri). I almost consider Yosemite the practice-version of what would become iOS 11 with it‚Äôs Windows 7 snap-style take on multitasking and it‚Äôs obsession with full screen. I will admit on the 13‚Äù MacBook Pro, and indeed on larger screens, full screen computing frustrates me; I do consider myself a ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù user (in the sense that I like to have lots going on with my screen at once),  but the iPad, with iOS 11, finally obliges my hardstuck ways.</p>

<p>The new operating system feels fluid and intuitive, and apps snap freely between iPad versions (in 50-100% size) and iPhone versions (at less than 50% size), leaving you able to do crazy things, like watching a YouTube video and reading BBC News at the same time. 2017 is crazy.</p>

<h2 id="accessories-are-power">accessories are power</h2>
<p>The iPad Pro carries much more than a shiny OS and multitasking, it is also backed by exclusive accessories. One of said accessories makes complete sense to me and I feel should be included with the device. The other is a ¬£99 stylus.</p>

<p>The iPad Pro Smart Keyboard is small, discreet, and doubles as a stand for when you don‚Äôt want to type and just want to watch/play. The key travel is shallow and does take getting used it, but it carries a tactile feel and I‚Äôve been able to get up to full-speed typing within a few hours of using it. The keyboard supports all the usual array of shortcuts fresh from the Mac, including <code class="highlighter-rouge">cmd+tab</code> (iOS now sports a cute task switched) and <code class="highlighter-rouge">cmd+h</code> to go to the home screen. Where the struggle begins is more to do with what I‚Äôm used to. I‚Äôm missing my 7‚Äù slab of glass underneath the space bar that lets me point to things on my screen<sup><a href="#footnotes/pointing">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The Apple Pencil is difficult. In theory I feel like it makes complete sense. The pencil is to the iPad Pro what the Smart Keyboard is to the iPad Pro. One lets you write away and pro-user-shortcut your way around the device, and seems the perfect match for writers; the other is a pencil. And I guess the pencil carries with it the ability to draw, and point with greater accuracy, or colour, or stencil, or whatever, but for me it‚Äôs come as an expensive ‚Äúalso this‚Äù. I‚Äôm not saying there‚Äôs anything inherently <em>wrong</em> with the thing‚Äîit feels weighted in your hand and is precise <em>af</em>‚Äîrather, it just doesn‚Äôt feel like it holds a true‚Ä¶ use for me. I have, however, still found myself reaching for it instead of pointing with my finger whilst using the Smart Keyboard, as it bridges the gap quite nicely and leaves me not having to lean in to point.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DnGmAzf.jpg" alt="iPad with Pencil and Smart Keyboard" /></p>

<h2 id="so-who-is-this-for">so who is this for?</h2>
<p>The iPad Pro sits on the forefront of what can only be described as a two-pronged niche. On one hand are the professionals who needs a solid, reliable, tablet to draw on or write with. iOS has really matured over the years and the operating system can finally comfortably support a power user with their ‚Äúlighter‚Äù tasks, and almost all apps from the App Store support some kind of hand off to a fully fledged power app on the Mac proper. On the other hand, the iPad Pro sits in a rather new market; the ‚ÄúPro Consumer‚Äù. Some people (particularly me‚Ä¶ and probably other nerds) need a device that is light enough and good enough to run YouTube, Music, and a couple of games without choking; but also heavy-duty enough to keep up, multitask, and carry through an entire day without a charge<sup><a href="#footnotes/battery-life">2</a></sup>. I think Apple has truly reimagined what the word ‚ÄúPro‚Äù means in it‚Äôs Pro line, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs short for Professional anymore.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2>
<p>The iPad Pro presents itself as a Microsoft Surface killer, but I think Apple missed the mark there. What I really see the iPad Pro as is a MacBook Air killer. This device is exactly what I wanted in Uni, and to be honest it fits my niche quite well. If you‚Äôre anything like me and you need a ‚ÄúPro by 2017‚Äôs Pro‚Äù device, I‚Äôd recommend buying the shit outta this device. For anyone else, I think a trip to the Apple Store to just have a play with the thing would soon swing you into the former category.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nt9kry8.jpg" alt="iPad with Tom" />
(‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a computer?‚Äù ‚Äî Whilst I find it completely obnoxious when taken literally, I totally get where the marketing department was coming from with that line‚Ä¶ sorry)</p>
<hr />
<p><a name="footnotes/pointing">1</a>: The touch screen on the iPad is incredibly responsive, 20ms to be precise, however there is a learning curve for keyboard and mouse diehards such as myself to learn to reach out and touch rather than using a secondary device.</p>

<p><a name="footnotes/battery-life">2</a>: Apple has claimed 10 hours on devices before and been very, very wrong (and have stung me for that, thanks man). So far the iPad Pro seems to live true to the 10 hour claim, though I‚Äôd be silly to bet against that changing after more battery cycles.</p>

<hr />

<p>I completed A-level Computing back in college which taught me a couple of valuable lessons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>VB.NET is a cruel mistress, but Stockholm Syndrome has me only remembering the good times</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It‚Äôs not about being able to program; it‚Äôs about being able to problem solve</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôve seen quite a few people online raving about Swift (particularly the videos Apple uploaded showing everyone from babies to grandparents writing apps in Swift) and had some spare hours between work, sleep, and <em>Crash Bandicoot</em>; so I‚Äôve started to try pick up Swift to see what I can accomplish.</p>

<p>Apple has a fantastic free eBook they keep updated for learning the basics of Swift as well as a website they maintain with a primer as well as a PHP.net style function breakdown. It goes without saying that documentation is king.</p>

<h2 id="so-wtf-is-fizzbuzz">so wtf is fizzbuzz</h2>

<p>FizzBuzz is a children‚Äôs game which some companies use in interviews when hiring programmers.</p>

<p>FizzBuzz is a game where two people take turns reciting numbers from 1-100 (or higher). If a number is a multiple of 3 the person must say ‚ÄúFizz‚Äù instead, if a number is a multiple of 5: ‚ÄúBuzz‚Äù, and for both ‚ÄúFizzBuzz‚Äù. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1</li>
  <li>2</li>
  <li>fizz</li>
  <li>3</li>
  <li>buzz</li>
  <li>fizz</li>
  <li>7</li>
  <li>8</li>
  <li>fizz</li>
  <li>buzz</li>
  <li>11</li>
  <li>fizz</li>
  <li>13</li>
  <li>14</li>
  <li>fizzbuzz</li>
</ul>

<p>Asking a programmer to reproduce this should be a very easy task, but it does also provide a great insight into what style of programmer they are. Do they slap shit together and hope for the best? Or do they actually think of edge cases and future-proofing?</p>

<p>There‚Äôs tonnes of great resources online on FizzBuzz, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc">this video</a> by Tom Scott on the various methods people use to solve FizzBuzz. My method is below, in Swift.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="mi">100</span> <span class="p">{</span>

There‚Äôs been a few times this year I‚Äôve half-started a post and then just kind of left it‚Äìand that‚Äôs okay! Here‚Äôs some of my accomplishments so far this year. (<em>Suck it, 2017</em>)</h3>

<hr />

<p>Time flies.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the year <a href="/2017/01/01/my-annual-year">I looked back at 2016</a> and took stock on what had been happening so far (TL;DR: time moves pretty quick). Flash forward to July and I‚Äôve realised I have neglected this blog. I also realised that doesn‚Äôt really matter.</p>

<h2 id="reflection-is-a-powerful-tool">reflection is a powerful tool</h2>

<p>In January I took a lot of time reflecting before writing my post, this was a very powerful thing to do. For one: it put a lot of things into perspective; huge problems seemed tiny in hindsight, secondly, it allowed me to put a lot of what I‚Äôd done into words‚Äìand that had a really huge impact. Sometimes accomplishments are drowned out by the problems of the time, problems that seem insignificant in the long run.</p>

<p>2017 has been a very good year so far. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there‚Äôs been the usual fair share of good days and shit days, but I‚Äôm finally starting to maintain a sense of purpose through it all (25 years late, mind).</p>

<h2 id="i-am-still-in-love-with-snapchat">i am still in love with snapchat</h2>

<p>I mentioned last time that I had managed to shake my perpetual social network anxiety, scrolling back through Photos.app shows that hasn‚Äôt changed. This has the benefit of me being able to take small amounts of time just scroll through my photos and reminisce over when stuff goes right.</p>

<h2 id="promises-promises">promises promises</h2>

<p>Gonna try to update this blog a little more regularly for the rest of the year. I also want to have a go at a video of some kind (waiting on Josh to let me use his drone). Also, I got an Apple Watch‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry.</p>

<p>I sit on a new bed in the same room wearing my second ever pair of joggers typing on a new MacBook Pro after drinking a bottle of Cava to myself. But how did I get here? In <em>The Onion</em> fashion, this is: ‚Äú<strong>my annual year</strong>‚Äù.</p>

<hr />

<p>In <a href="/2015/11/16/time-passes">November 2015</a> I reflected on the life I was living, and alluded to a discontent in <em>how</em> I was living said life:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe I‚Äôll
fall into the same slump as before (again even if only slightly), or maybe I‚Äôll
manage just enough of a change to nudge myself into another New Tom. Future Tom.
 I hope he looks back at this release and cringes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I‚Äôm looking back and I‚Äôm not cringing. This self-reflection really put gears in motion in my mind to produce what has become one of my favourite years alive so far.</p>

<h2 id="2016-the-year-of-did-i-do-that">2016: the year of ‚Äúdid <em>I</em> do that?‚Äù</h2>

<p>My greatest accomplishment in 2016 stood on the shoulders of my second-greatest: I became a manager at <em>big red</em>. I was voted ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Choice‚Äù for best Customer Service Team Leader/Adviser. Now, I‚Äôm not the work obsessed gremlin ranking such an achievement would suggest, but it was the moment I accepted what I meant to others. I saw my best friend cry as I took the prize and felt like I‚Äôd really done them proud, in fact, I‚Äôd done <em>myself</em> proud.</p>

<h2 id="my-biggest-change-i-lost-my-socialnetworkanxiety">my biggest change: I lost my social(<em>network</em>)anxiety</h2>

<p>2016 was the first year I actually enjoyed public social networks. From Twitter to SnapChat and Instagram and back I actually enjoyed sharing my life on social networks. Actually, no, I wasn‚Äôt hung up on exactly what I was sharing anymore because I was just sharing snippets of my life. I think that‚Äôs kinda the point though, so go me for finally getting it?</p>

<p>I just spent 20 minutes or so reviewing Photos on the MacBook (which, by the way, is fucking seamless) and it reminded me of how much I‚Äôve actually done this year, and more surprisingly, how much I‚Äôve actually documented. Fuck, I‚Äôve even taken <em>selfies</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://s23.postimg.org/hnm2fqti3/IMG_0289.jpg" alt="selfie" width="200px" style="float:right; padding-left: 10px;" /></p>

<p>I seemed to finally, after 24 years, crack the answer to the age-old question of ‚Äúhow do you want it?‚Äù when going to the barbers. In doing that (and after receiving at least <em>one</em> compliment) I‚Äôve found myself taking much more pictures of my face. Until tonight I really didn‚Äôt appreciate how useful that actually is, as it‚Äôs enabled me to take stock on a lot of positives this year (<em>right: German Christmas market with Alex</em>). On a serious note, it‚Äôs really shown how much my confidence has improved this year on the whole‚Äìfor one I‚Äôm now leading a team of 12 people which requires a lot of public speaking, which I‚Äôm unashamedly loving!</p>

<p>Something as quick and dirty as I‚Äôm making here needs a dirty and quick array:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">tags</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="s1">'Registered CSS offender.'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s1">'Mum, I</span><span class="se">\'</span><span class="s1">m on the Internet!'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s1">'#implications'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s1">'Powered by magic beans'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s1">'Brought to you by Caprisuns'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s1">'A new design every week or your money back'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s1">'Come on, grab your friends!'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s1">'Follow me on Twitter!'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s1">'Steamed hams'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s1">'My other blog gets updates'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s1">'&lt;i&gt;"lol"&lt;/i&gt; - you'</span>
<span class="p">];</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="step-two-pseudorandom-number-generator">step two: pseudorandom number generator</h2>

<p>Anyone who‚Äôs ever done ‚Äúrandomness‚Äù in computer programming before knows the general formula <code class="highlighter-rouge">random() * (max - min + 1)) + min</code> (where <code class="highlighter-rouge">random()</code> generally gives a number between 0 and 1). I won‚Äôt pretend to understand or remember how this works, however if you‚Äôre interested in the how check <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1527820">this excellent explanation</a> on StackOverflow out.</p>

<p>Now since our array starts at 0 (so we have no min), our next‚Äìand only other‚Äìline can just be:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">random_tag</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">tags</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">Math</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">round</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">Math</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">random</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">tags</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))];</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="step-three-its-lit">step three: it‚Äôs lit</h2>

<p>Throw in a cheeky tag into where you want your random tag:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;span</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">random-tag</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>then add a not so cheeky <code class="highlighter-rouge">document.addEventListener</code> to insert <code class="highlighter-rouge">random_tag</code> into your page:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"DOMContentLoaded"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">event</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"random-tag"</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">innerHTML</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">" "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">random_tag</span>
<span class="p">})</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="theres-probably-a-better-way-to-do-this">there‚Äôs probably a better way to do this</h2>

<p>Full disclosure: I generally have no idea what I‚Äôm doing, so if you know of or find a better way of performing this fairly simple task: go ahead and use it.</p>

<p>So yeah, I got the job.</p>

<h2 id="deep-end-">deep end üåä</h2>

<p>After a full week managing I think I can safely say I will never think I know everything in a job role ever again. All internal (<em>and external</em>) panicking aside, I bought myself a Moleskine diary and a journal, in a thinly veiled attempt to look organised.</p>

<h2 id="prioritising">prioritising</h2>

<p>I find now that if I don‚Äôt tackle more tasks than I have set, I‚Äôm going to feel like I had an unproductive day. Sometimes this will happen, however what I‚Äôve tried to do is always make sure I have three tasks that I will focus on; it could be a specific objective or a broad task, but as long as I can say I tackled my three priorities I can say I‚Äôve at least had a productive day.</p>

<h2 id="day-planning">day planning</h2>

<p>I take around twenty minutes per day laying out how I would like my day to go. This is done by writing down every task I can think of in any order. I then mark important tasks with a *, tasks that <strong>need</strong> doing with a !, tasks that require research with a üîé and tasks that can be delegated with ‚Üí. As the day progresses I can mark tasks started with a ‚ö´Ô∏è and tick off completed items.</p>

<h2 id="meetings">meetings</h2>

<p>Meetings are inevitable, but it‚Äôs a good idea to pen them in. Having something pop up in Outlook is also good, but for the times I‚Äôm not at my computer it‚Äôs good to just pop open the book and see what I have coming up.</p>

<h2 id="workbasket">workbasket</h2>

<p>Something I added after having a chat with another manager is a ‚Äúworkbasket‚Äù, it‚Äôs a view of how I feel my time has been spent on any given day. I break the day down into its seven working hours, and give each block a code as to what I feel I was spending most of my time doing, be it meetings, management, coaching or feedback. There‚Äôs no perfect balance of activities and not every day will feature every task, but it gives me an idea of how I‚Äôm spending my time; plus it gives me a heads up as to why I might be getting behind on a task (for example, if my observations are behind, maybe I should be spending more time doing feedback or coaching).</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VMWX2OPm.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For the diary I cut out one of the Author of the Weeks from the <a href="http://moleskine.com/template">MSK/template</a> website.</p>

<h2 id="u-do-u">u do u</h2>

<p>All this said and done, I think everyone will find their own magic super secret way to organise themselves. I think the biggest thing to focus on isn‚Äôt anything to do with organisation or making sure you act the part; it‚Äôs asking for help. Attaching to as many people who have been in your position to find what you need to do and how you can do it can be the difference between whether you succeed or fail, because at this stage tasks are rarely delegated from above.</p>

<p>As I alluded to in a previous rant, I have the unnatural talent of allowing myself into slumping. By this I mean I can be quite content in the art of settling. I‚Äôm coming up to the two-year mark at <em>big red bank</em>, and until very recently I was reaching a similar position I was in this time last year: complacency.</p>

<p>In my last month‚Äôs career conversation my manager hit the nail on the head; I am happy to silently pay my dues, get on with the work and take no recognition for it. I hit &gt;90% of my performance indicators, I cause little to no drama and I don‚Äôt like to draw any attention to myself. She continued that she fears I will become bored in my role, so she offered I become an SME in a new focus for the bank: digital opportunities, in order to give me something new to do. Alongside this she suggested I keep an open mind about ‚Äúprogression‚Äù, to which I agreed. Later that day I applied for a manager job. Not even four days later I‚Äôm told I have a preliminary interview on Monday.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt necessarily think I‚Äôll even pass the prelim stage, hell I‚Äôm surprised my <cite>written in thirty minutes oh Dog I sent it before even proof-reading it</cite> cover letter even got me this far; but so far my Saturday has been spent swatting up on policies and procedures a manager undertakes ready for a roleplay and a presentation. Oh boy.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-else-is-new">so what else is new?</h2>

<p>I bought myself a Ducky One keyboard, partly because I quite fancy taking up writing (be it notes, blogs, reviews, stories I‚Äôll never publish) and the Ducky is renowned for being a delight to type on‚Äîwhich it is‚Äîbut also because CLACK CLACK. The sound of a fully mechanical, cherry switched keyboard is just downright‚Ä¶ pleasurable to type on (see attached YouTube video for evidence).</p>

<p>After a few months of owning a PS4 and a PS Vita I‚Äôve established a fairly healthy amount of games to play through. I recently completed played through <em>Uncharted 4, Until Dawn, Ratchet and Clank, Rogue Warrior, Hyper Light Drifter, NBA 2k16</em> and <em>The Last of Us</em>, thanks to PlayStation Plus however, the list doesn‚Äôt go down at any scary speed. I still have <em>Dragon Age, Uncharted: Golden Abyss, Gravity Falls, Life is Strange</em> and <em>Persona 4</em> to chug through, I might even hit this shit up with some notes or a review about them. All the while I‚Äôm mid-Gold on <em>League of Legends</em>, though with the shake up in the ranked queue system I really don‚Äôt know if I can get carried to Platinum again like last season, but y‚Äôknow.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-the-plan">so what‚Äôs the plan?</h2>

<p>Lawyer up, hit the gym, delete Facebook. Seriously though I have no idea, <em>voice in my head</em>, I can see myself going in a few different directions and to be honest I kind of like the idea of all of them. Hopefully I learn enough from failing my assessment on Monday to get a shoe onto the ladder, if not: I have things lined up still, I‚Äôm happy enough where I am, albeit I would love to move out (big up the rental market); but that takes money. Money I keep spending on Ducky keyboards and every games console going. Adulting is easy, right?</p>

<p>And oh yeah, <em>Pok√©mon Go</em> is a thing.</p>

   <title>hyper light drifter üéÆ</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/game-review/2016/04/27/hyper-light-drifter/"/>
   <updated>2016-04-27T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/game-review/2016/04/27/hyper-light-drifter</id>
    <content type="html"><p>Having now dabbled in the <em>Souls</em> series I can say with certainty that I am a
masochist.</p>

<p>Hyper Light Drifter appeared on my Steam queue as a game it thought I would like
 (<em>as Steam does</em>). After reading the reviews and watching a couple of the
videos, I was sold. 30 minutes later I was hooked.</p>

<h2 id="okay-ill-try-one-more-time-then-im-going-to-bed">‚Äòokay, i‚Äôll try one more time then i‚Äôm going to bed‚Äô</h2>

<p>Hyper Light Drifter is a game about‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt really know. The only
backstory you get is from the odd cutscene which is backed by the game‚Äôs
incredible soundtrack. The cutscenes are not spoken. There are no subtitles.
The only ‚Äòlanguage‚Äô is the odd grunt from NPCs. So far all I can tell is the PC
has some sort of illness that makes him periodically cough up blood, and some
friendly fella took him to a central city. From this central city you are free
to tackle the game in any direction you like. From what I have begun to gather
from the game the objective is to dungeon crawl four areas which piece together
four‚Ä¶ things. These things seem to be the focal point of the game. I have
encountered a couple of NPCs who have tried to distract me with what looks
like optional boss rooms, but I‚Äôm not too sure yet (I‚Äôm only 30-40% through the
game).</p>

<p>The game‚Äôs central mechanic revolves around timing. This game is <em>fucking hard</em>.
You are given 5 hit points (which I am yet to find a way to increase), and the
game is lightly littered with HP boosters (which get you from any health to max).
But it‚Äôs not about hit points or healing‚Äìit‚Äôs about getting it fucking right.</p>

<div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:calc(100% / 1.78)"><iframe src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/DecisiveCrispAphid" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>The PC has three real moves (more if you collect the games rare ‚Äòcurrency‚Äô).
A hack/slash, a gun which recharges bullets from hacking/slashing and your
bread and butter: a dash which can be used three times in quick succession.
Each game area usually has an exploration area, followed by some warm up creatures
unique to that area. Then there is a ‚Äòboss room‚Äô which throws everything at you
at once. After a succession of deaths you slowly learn the
area‚Äôs pattern, you change your style, you become more patient. You <em>become</em> a
ninja. This game does not allow a simple -run in hack slash spam A- approach, in
fact, it <em>punishes</em> it; and when you finally get that checkpoint and quadrant,
holy fuck does it feel rewarding.</p>

<h1 id="you-could-legit-gfycat-any-scene-in-this-game">you could legit gfycat any scene in this game</h1>

<p>This game is downright beautiful. It‚Äôs ambiance is created by the amazing
backdrop and colours, combined with it‚Äôs sombre soundtrack, which slowly builds
up from the melodic piano in the safe habour central city up to the rhythmic
dungeon crawling soundtrack (which really gets me in the zone). Occasionally
the game feels fairly <em>wtf</em>, particularly with it‚Äôs non-language cryptic
backstory and random blood-coughing moments, but on the whole Hyper Light Drifter
feels like a game that should cost more than it‚Äôs ¬£15.99 price tag.</p>

    <content type="html"><iframe width="650" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/W_rC-495Z_A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="1"> </iframe>

<p>I‚Äôve started working on SquareCMS again recently after having some time off work, the <a href="//github.com/tomchatting/square">GitHub</a> is being updated a lot more and there‚Äôs a working demo <a href="//square-shiftysu.rhcloud.com">here</a> if you want to have a play.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CYyqyD7.png" alt="square admin" /></p>

<h2 id="so-will-i-go-back-to-running-on-square">so will i go back to running on square?</h2>

<p>Probably not, simply because I‚Äôm so used to running my blog as a git repo now, and I love GitHub flavoured markdown (which I‚Äôm probably going to build a plugin for Square anyway).</p>

<h2 id="so-why-do-it">so why do it?</h2>

<p>Because I actually want to, and I actually enjoy writing code again.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-to-come-false-promises-time">so what‚Äôs to come? (false promises time)</h2>

<p>So at the moment I‚Äôm focusing on getting the thing working as it was before (over five years ago), but there <em>is</em> some stuff I want to work on adding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>full plugin support (the PDO should help here)</li>
  <li>shit tonnes better documentation</li>
  <li>multi-user support (although I‚Äôm not too sure on this one)</li>
  <li>ability to add custom tags without changing a line of code (thinking of how Jekyll handles custom tags in the layout of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> markdown files)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="when-will-20-drop-its-alpha-tag">when will 2.0 drop it‚Äôs alpha tag?</h2>

<p>Well, it‚Äôll go beta when I‚Äôm ready, and it‚Äôll go final when I‚Äôm ready too. So basically don‚Äôt hold your breath.</p>

   <updated>2016-02-23T21:20:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/article/2016/02/23/quick-and-dirty-referencing</id>
    <content type="html"><p>One lesson all uni students should have in their schedules every year is a
lecture from the librarian of their school. In my case that was a recently
graduated Humanities student (because who else would be the Sciences librarian?)
who would give us the same talk every year on the importance of referencing.</p>

<p>Though boring as hell, I didn‚Äôt realise how lucky I was to receive something like
this so consistently during my years at uni; it was only after I discovered
my sister was never taught to reference.</p>

<iframe width="650" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/XF3pG6DndYs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="1"> </iframe>

<h1 id="turn-it-in-and-you-and-the-devil-too">turn it in and you (and the devil, too!)</h1>

<p>All universities in this day and age use some sort of plagiarism ‚Äòdetecting‚Äô
tool such as turnitin to sort the cheats from the heroes. Most of these
are terrible, terrible pieces of pseudo-ware which simply plug your work
through Google et al to try and work out if you just copy-pasted Wikipedia.</p>

<p>To combat this, the primary school child in you will automatically begin
rewriting what you are copying into your own words, but this is where the basic
rule of academic writing steps in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if you write anything which cannot be considered your own thought or idea, it <strong>must</strong> be referenced (Chatting, 2016)</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="building-references">building references</h1>

<p>Wherever possible, you should compile a list of the sources you use for each
page of your writing (<em>just stick it in the footer</em>) so you can go back once
it‚Äôs finished so you can build your bibliography (which I‚Äôll touch on later).</p>

<p>For books, grab the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>author‚Äôs name(s)</li>
  <li>year of publication</li>
  <li>book title</li>
  <li>edition (if not the 1st)</li>
  <li>city of publication</li>
  <li>publisher</li>
</ul>

<p>For journal articles, you‚Äôll need the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>author‚Äôs name(s)</li>
  <li>year the journal was published</li>
  <li>title of the article</li>
  <li>title of the journal</li>
  <li>the page number or range of pages of the article</li>
  <li>volume and issue numbers where you can provide them</li>
</ul>

<p>For ‚Äòelectronic resources‚Äô, try to get the above plus the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>date you accessed the sources</li>
  <li>the URL or email</li>
  <li>type of resource (email, forum, website, etc)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="quotes-vs-interpretation">quotes vs interpretation</h1>

<p>If you ever use the idea of another person or quote someone (which you should
keep to a bare minimum) you should be looking to add a reference. You can get
away with not using a reference <strong>only</strong> when the information can be considered
public domain, for example stating that the 6‚Äôo‚Äôclock News generally airs at 6pm.</p>

<h2 id="direct-quotes">direct quotes</h2>

<p>If you ever copy what an author says word-for-word, use inverted commas or
double inverted commas to wrap the phrase and follow it immediately with your
reference. Do not modify the sentence in anyway, leaving mistakes as they are.
You can correct any errors and show your reader you recognise them by using <em>(sic)</em>.</p>

<h2 id="referencing-interpretation">referencing interpretation</h2>

<p>This is how you should be completing the majority of your academic writing, as
it is a true display of your understanding of a topic. You must still reference
the ideas, and this is done by quoting the author‚Äôs surname and the year of
publication in brackets.</p>

<h1 id="referencing-the-actual-way-to-do-it">referencing (the actual way to do it)</h1>

<p>Harvard referencing can be broken down into two parts: the article‚Äôs body, and
the reference list.</p>

<p>The article body points at the reference list using the author‚Äôs surname and
date, which is then displayed in full with the source used in the reference
list, for example if I were to say: referencing is a fking ballache.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chatting (2016) suggests referencing is a tedious process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Summarises the gist of what I said, whereas a direct quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chatting (2016) stated ‚Äòreferencing is a fking(sic) ballache‚Äô</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Referencing a journal or book might look like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>F. D. Martinez, 2007. ‚ÄúGenes, environments, development and asthma: a reappraisal‚Äù doi: 10.1183/‚Äã09031936.00087906ERJ January 1, 2007 vol. 29 1 179-184</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While referencing this website may look like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chatting, T (2016) ‚Äòquick and dirty referencing‚Äô, <em>tom</em> [Online], Available: <a href="http://tomchatting.github.io/article/2016/02/23/quick-and-dirty-referencing.html">http://tomchatting.github.io/article/2016/02/23/quick-and-dirty-referencing.html</a> [23 Feb 2016]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your reference list should be organised in alphabetical order (by author‚Äôs surname)
or in logical order (the order in which you referenced them in the body).</p>

<h2 id="let-your-references-run-free">let your references run free</h2>

<p>The tl;dr of all this is please reference or you will fail/have an academic
integrity review and that will be a bad thing. There is no ‚Äògood‚Äô number of
references to aim for, but there is no such thing as too many references.</p>

<hr />

<p>Layout and some examples taken from the University of Exeter‚Äôs Study Skills guide
to referencing found <a href="https://education.exeter.ac.uk/dll/studyskills/harvard_referencing.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>A fantastic tool for creating reference guides/bibliographies is <a href="http://www.neilstoolbox.com/bibliography-creator/">Neil‚Äôs Toolbox</a>, to which I would

<p><img src="http://zippy.gfycat.com/CalculatingApprehensiveAtlanticridleyturtle.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>But this isn‚Äôt art, it‚Äôs a release. Or is a release a kind of art?</p>

<p>Since May, I can‚Äôt think of a massive amount in my life that has changed, but a
lot of minor things can be reeled off the top of my head which I think add up
to a fairly huge change.</p>

<h2 id="i-now-own-my-first-and-only-pair-of-tracksuit-bottoms">I now own my first and only pair of tracksuit bottoms</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve left the phase of my life where I‚Äôd revolve around the PC: bed, PC; work,
PC; home, PC; eat, PC; bed.</p>

<p>In a quest to free myself from the chair and desk, I bought a MacBook Air and a
Kindle; using the money from an accolade at work to fund several books. I burned
 through the books and used the MacBook as an ASMR machine. I bought loose
fitting tracksuit bottoms and plain-cotton tees. I wrote a lot of letters to
people which I‚Äôd never deliver. I culled my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/tomchatting/playlist/06BE3SX9j3lDJVSdaHCgRh">Spotify playlist</a> and started
again. But I always find a way to relapse, even if slightly. I write this post
after a week of computer-slump. I have neglected the MacBook, left the Kindle
in deep sleep, and reverted my Spotify playlist. Maybe people can‚Äôt change.</p>

<p>I remember when I once idolised a friend (and part-time lover), and I could
never understand their obsession with ‚Äòmaking a change‚Äô, pledging every other
month that they‚Äôd finally break their mould and get a full-time lover, a
fulfilling job, move out of the house. It seemingly never happened, until the
proactivity from a new interest ended up in everything falling into place.
They‚Äôre getting married now, fuck, even having a kid; and yet here I lay, still
pledging to not committing until I‚Äôm ready, still ultimately alone.</p>

<h2 id="dont-take-for-granted-one-you-can-confide-in-because-once-theyre-gone-theres-no-lonelier-place">Don‚Äôt take for granted one you can confide in, because once they‚Äôre gone there‚Äôs no lonelier place</h2>

<p>Although I count myself lucky enough to have three close (<em>best</em>) friends, I
find myself no longer having someone I can tell <em>everything</em>. My idol was the
one I would share everything with, and they reciprocated. Although at the time
it felt very natural and familiar, now they‚Äôre gone there‚Äôs a crippling
loneliness that could almost be mistaken for sadness. But it‚Äôs not: it‚Äôs real
life.</p>

<h2 id="ultimately-i-may-have-inadvertently-done-a-lot-of-growing-up-over-the-past-12-months">Ultimately I may have inadvertently done a lot of growing up over the past 12 months</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs my 12 months anniversary of starting my job at <code class="highlighter-rouge">Big Red Bank</code>. I‚Äôve
never missed a day, I‚Äôve never been later than 30 minutes early. Head down,
full-charge. Every. Damn. Day. I look back at myself 12 months ago and see
a much shyer, reclusive young man. Working at a call centre has a very important
 early lesson: talk spreads. That includes information about myself. Some people
 embrace me, others do not. But ultimately the difference between now Tom and
then Tom is: I simply don‚Äôt care.</p>

<p>So where does this leave the next 12 months? I still have short-term goals. But
I‚Äôm looking much more long-term than I ever have before. I want to learn more
culture, I want to develop my vocabulary, I want to try new food. Maybe I‚Äôll
fall into the same slump as before (again even if only slightly), or maybe I‚Äôll
manage just enough of a change to nudge myself into another New Tom. Future Tom.
 I hope he looks back at this release and cringes.</p>

   <title>Supporting in Season 2015</title>

<p>Ah Season 2015, smiting champions, Cinderhulk, super-mega-special-super-special-awesome Baron buff, Dragon stacks and <em>crazy ass</em> support builds. Let‚Äôs jump in head first!</p>

<h3 id="just-buy-this-and-win">Just buy this and win</h3>

<blockquote>
  <h3 id="righteous-glory-2500g">Righteous Glory 2500g</h3>
  <p>UNIQUE ACTIVE: Grants +60% Movement Speed to you and nearby allies when moving towards enemies for 3 seconds. When this speed boost ends, it emits a shockwave, slowing nearby enemy champions by 80% for one second. 60 second cooldown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will legitimately be shocked if Righteous Glory goes without a nerf or three before the seasons end; it gives champions with normally zero chase-engage (Annie, Morgana) a Shurelya‚Äôs Reverie (or Talisman or Ascension) combined with a Randuin‚Äôs Omen. Hell, once you‚Äôve finished it, you might as well take a Talisman and a Randuin‚Äôs anyway and just stack that sucker up!</p>

<h3 id="theres-building-boots-and-buying-a-ward-on-first-back-and-theres-an-incorrect-back">There‚Äôs building boots and buying a ward on first back and there‚Äôs an incorrect back</h3>

<p>Roaming and edging advantages means more than ever this season, games are incredibly hard to close out when even with tower buffs, the easiest way to do this is the roam for ward placement/cheeky ganks on mid. Or you know‚Ä¶ do it at level one.</p>

<h3 id="what-the-fuck-is-that-build">‚ÄúWhat the fuck is that build‚Ä¶‚Äù</h3>

<p>Zero AP Annie/Morgana sounds like trash, but support this season isn‚Äôt about carrying with damage, it‚Äôs about carrying with <a href="http://matchhistory.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/EUW1/2092496922/36795625?tab=stats">utility</a>.</p>

   <title>Dropping mysql_connect, or how I learned to PDO</title>

   <title>Tom does reading: Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/article/2014/11/07/hard-boiled-wonderland-and-the-end-of-the-world/"/>

    <content type="html"><h3 id="how-i-fell-in-love-with-murakami">How I fell in love with Murakami</h3>

<p>In my quest to invest myself more heavily in Japanese culture (beyond Japanese game shows and manga) I decided to plunge into the world of Japanese literature. After much thought and blurb-reading, I happened upon <em>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</em> by Haruki Murakami. The author, speculated to have been shortlisted for the Nobel Prize for Literature multiple times, is said to be ‚Äúpoetic‚Äù in his writing style; easy to read, yet thought-provoking and impactful. I was told to expect a mix of ‚Äúwestern-style fantasy‚Äù and ‚Äúscience-fiction mystery‚Äù, and boy, does Murakami deliver.</p>

<p>The novel follows two narratives which standalone and later intertwine: <em>Hard-Boiled Wonderland</em> tells the story of a successful corporate/government agent, dutifully fulfilling his set tasks whilst enjoying an almost pragmatic lifestyle, in a tone not dissimilar to the narrators in <em>The Humans</em> or <em>The Curious Tale</em>. <em>The End of the World</em> tells the tale of a lost soul, who departs with his shadow to gain entry to a town at the end of the world. He is given the task of ‚Äúdream reading‚Äù until such a time his shadow dies, and he can become immortal and ‚Äúat one‚Äù with the town which protects him from the outside world that all within strive to forget.</p>

<p>The pure beauty of Murakami‚Äôs writing is that even within the translation, subtleties creep in. It took me half a dozen chapters (and a re-read of two) to realise the author never actually divulges the name of a single character, yet his writing style and descriptive narrative leave me questioning whether a name is ever needed. The author also switches between the personal past tense and present tense in alternate chapters in such a subtle way, leaving a strong satisfaction as you try to puzzle the ending together.</p>

<p>A fascinating mystery science-fiction adventure with an ending that leaves you to think. <em>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</em> is a fantastic introduction to an obviously strong writer and, as my new copy of <em>A Wild Sheep Chase</em> suggests, is a great gateway novel to more of the same.</p>

<p>‚ô¶ 4.5/5</p>

<p>While device optimisation appears to be the Flavour of The Year(TM) effort for web developers, many (such as I) may find this laborious.</p>

<h2 id="smack-it-with-snippets-until-it-works">Smack it with snippets until it works</h2>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"viewport"</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">"width=device-width, user-scalable=no"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above demands mobile browsers (namely Safari and Chrome) back-off on their normal charade of imitating fullscreen browsers, and instead report their true width to the CSS, meaning users are served what is considered a ‚Äúmobile‚Äù friendly site.</p>

<p>This is only one part of the puzzle, however, since you will still need to scale your content in CSS accordingly.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nc">.wrapper</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nl">max-width</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">38rem</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nl">margin</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">0</span> <span class="nb">auto</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nl">padding-left</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">2%</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nl">padding-right</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">2%</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Something like the above keeps your site running at most resolutions with minimum work. Of course, it‚Äôs still recommended you scale fonts and the like using media queries; but we‚Äôre far too lazy for that now, aren‚Äôt we?</p>

   <title>HP Chromebook 11</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/note/2014/01/07/chromebook/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-07T14:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/note/2014/01/07/chromebook</id>
    <content type="html"><p>I‚Äôve had my eye on the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/chrome/devices/hp-chromebook-11/">Google/HP Chromebook 11</a> ever since it was announced and launched late 2013. In December, however, the device was recalled due to reports of the charger <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/13/5099570/best-buy-removes-hp-chromebook-11-from-stores">overheating, melting, and in some cases burning users</a>. So of course, being the impatient guy I am, I bought a ‚Äúused for one week‚Äù Chromebook with a faulty charger from eBay for the steal price of ¬£190 (RRP is ¬£229 and, as of writing, is still not available). Being away from University over the holidays means I‚Äôve been away from my gaming PC, leading the Chromebook to be my main machine for the past week or so; so I thought it‚Äôd be good to offload some details/feelings about the device.</p>

<h2 id="this-is-the-best-screen-on-any-device-ive-used">This is the best screen on any device I‚Äôve used.</h2>

<p>Hands down, the 1366x768 IPS display is the best screen on any device I‚Äôve ever used. Ever. I‚Äôm still not used to how high the pixel density is, nor am I used to the incredible brightness (I have to have the device at 80% brightness even when plugged in). Small text is clear, fonts are beautifully rendered, blacks are black and colours are bright and vibrant. You‚Äôd be looking at paying for a retina Macbook or iPad for screen quality <em>this</em> good on any other device.</p>

<h2 id="the-year-old-exynos-5-still-screams">The year old Exynos 5 still screams</h2>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7o8ujnf.png" alt="Meta" /></p>

<p>The Samsung Exynos 5 dual-core ARMv7 processor the Chromebook contains is the exact same chip that‚Äôs inside the Samsung Series 3 from 2012 (which is still on sale at a slightly lower price today), and it‚Äôs performance shows why Google chose it over putting something newer (and therefore, more expensive) inside the 11. As of writing, I have a Chrome port of Brackets, the code editor I use, called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tailor/mfakmogheanjhlgjhpijkhdjegllgenf/related?hl=en">Tailor</a> running, Spotify playing, and 4 other tabs open in Chrome. Many times I can have two Twitch streams playing at ‚Äúsource‚Äù resolution (generally 1080p) without the Chromebook skipping a beat. This is <strong>insane</strong>, my mother‚Äôs ¬£600 Pavillion laptop running Windows 8.1 can‚Äôt do this, my ¬£550 year old gaming rig can barely do this, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs down to Windows vs Chrome OS or just the ability of the CPU, but this is insanity. Strangely, the Chromebook does struggle when playing audio with Google Play Music‚Äôs flash player when scrolling through heavy sites like <a href="http://theverge.com">The Verge</a>, but a couple of seconds of stuttering isn‚Äôt annoying enough to warrant a rant.</p>

<p>The speakers for the device are <em>under</em> the keyboard, and produce pretty solid stereo sound, on a par with a cheap set of external speakers, but far better than any previous laptop/phone I‚Äôve used.</p>

<h2 id="the-inputs">The inputs</h2>

<p>Dual microphone/headphone jacks are something I‚Äôm not used to on laptops, they‚Äôre more akin to a tablet or a smartphone, but then again, this laptop is basically a Nexus 10 inside a laptop shell, this means I‚Äôm also not as surprised that the Chromebook 11 supports micro-usb charging. At times, USB charging is incredibly handy: every friends or family members house I go to has a micro-USB cable lying around so I‚Äôm never without juice, but anything less than a 3 amp charger produces a warning on the device that more power will be used than can be provided, so charging will only occur when it‚Äôs turned off. Other than that, the device sports two USB 2.0 ports. And that‚Äôs it. HDMI output is possible via the micro-USB port, but dual power/video splitters cost in the region of ¬£20, so unless I become desperate to stream South Park onto a bigger monitor, I won‚Äôt be investing in that.</p>

<p>If the display weren‚Äôt so incredible, I would spend hours raving about this keyboard. Full size, chicklet style keys (a la Macbook) and lacking keys I never use (search replaces caps lock, Chrome specific keys replace F1-12), I can comfortably write for hours on the device. But therein can lie a problem.</p>

<h2 id="juice-may-be-an-issue">Juice may be an issue</h2>

<p>If you‚Äôre like me and can type consistently for several hours, you may hit a snag on a coach or train trip. Google specifies ‚Äúup to 6 hours of active use‚Äù. I can manage 7 at a pinch, but this isn‚Äôt a device that could, say, go days without a charge like a Nexus 7. The charger being micro-USB also produces an issue since charging to full from 10-20% can take up to 4 hours with the device on, so I‚Äôve found myself using my Nexus 4 charger overnight with the device off.</p>

<h2 id="there-is-no-longer-such-a-thing-as-offline">There is no longer such a thing as ‚Äúoffline‚Äù</h2>

<p>The biggest argument against Chromebooks it seems is a mystical condition known as ‚Äúoffline syndrome‚Äù. While the OS and its various apps now sport offline support/modes, I simply cannot think of a situation where I am offline for more than 30 minutes in a position I might want to use my laptop. With unlimited data on my phone and bluetooth/WiFi tethering, unless I‚Äôm headed through a tunnel or travelling to remote Cumbria, in 2014 I think there‚Äôs seldom a place you can be without data/WiFi (and if you are, a Starbucks/McDonalds with free WiFi is never far away).</p>

<h2 id="this-is-my-usage-yours-may-vary">This is my usage, yours may vary</h2>

<p>It is difficult to tell someone a Chromebook would work for them, because it depends on your use case. In my case, I needed a laptop that could use <a href="http://jstorrent.com/">torrents</a>, git (included in <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tailor/mfakmogheanjhlgjhpijkhdjegllgenf/related?hl=en">Tailor</a>), some form of document editor (included with Google Docs), the web, and last at least 6 hours without juice (since I have a gaming PC for the rest) and the Chromebook 11 hits all these points. So, <strong>go Scroogle yourself Microsoft</strong>.</p>

   <title>League of Legends: Supporting 101, a pre-season update</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/article/2013/11/28/supporting-part-2/"/>
   <updated>2013-11-28T22:30:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/article/2013/11/28/supporting-part-2</id>
    <content type="html"><div class="callout callout-warning">
As alluded to previously, here's another post on the popular <abbr title="Multiplayer online battle arena">MOBA</abbr> <a href="//leagueoflegends.com">League of Legends</a> with the aim of updating/rewriting some things from my <a href="http://dg9t.eu/article/2013/07/31/supporting-101.html">previous post</a> on how to support. As before, feel free to skip over this one. -- Tom
</div>

<iframe width="668" height="376" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Ebz0lVVbRho" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="1"> </iframe>

<p>Season 4 pre-season is here, and boy is it a doozy. If you haven‚Äôt already, I highly recommend hitting up the <a href="http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-314-notes">3.14 patch notes</a> or dropping into a few games in normal queue before playing ranked (<em>hypocrite alert, I just dove straight in</em>).</p>

<h2 id="new-season-new-pre-game">New season, new pre-game</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve branched out a tad, not only being forced to change my masteries (I still feel 0/13/17 is the best, for now) but also my runes.</p>

<p>I run three rune pages depending on the situation/champion I‚Äôm playing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Health, MR/level+Armour, and Gold/10</strong> - For champions like Blitz and Sona that got heavily nerfed last season as far as aggression is concerned (base HP nerfs), or in match-ups against high early level burst like Blitz or Graves</li>
  <li><strong>AP, Armour+Flat MR, and Magic Pen</strong> - For champions like Lulu and Sona who can glass cannon lane around levels 1-6 really hard. Even post nerf Sona can 100-50 any carry with a good <em>Q-Power Chord-Q</em> combo</li>
  <li><strong>Old school Gold, Flat AD, and MR/level+Armour</strong> - Running Gold Quints, and taking flat AD to get some more heavy poke on</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="who-works-now-who-doesnt">Who works now, who doesn‚Äôt</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve always been a believer in the idea that there is no such thing as a counter if you are good enough with someone. Regardless; Blitz still counters Sona, Lulu counters Leona, and Thresh just <em>shits</em> on everyone.</p>

<p>As far as the mages go (Annie, Lux, Nidalee); the same high risk/high reward system applies. If you can secure the kills and more importantly the <strong>gold</strong>, you can win a game just from bot lane. If you do not, you fall off: simple as.</p>

<h2 id="so-whos-the-strongest">So who‚Äôs the strongest?</h2>

<p>At the minute I believe it comes down to personal preference. High win rates can be found on Leona, Annie, Thresh, and Janna. Play someone who matches your style, or duo with someone you can effectively communicate with, because communication is more OP than a difficult lane match-up.</p>

<h2 id="starting-items-and-builds">Starting items and builds</h2>

<p>Thanks to the new trinkets and gold items (<em>and gold income</em>) support is incredibly diverse and actually exciting at the moment. As of writing, <em>Spoils of War</em> has been nerfed‚Äìafter it was discovered how ridiculous a ranged support <em>and</em> a marksman were when both started with it‚Äìto apply to melee auto-attacks only, but the item is still incredibly strong (think of a healing Leona/Blitzcrank).</p>

<p>My builds tend to focus on either offence or defence now, building a gold item and a sightstone first, then focussing on something like a Rabadon‚Äôs Deathcap or a DFG if it‚Äôs going well (The AP Mage‚Äôs ‚Äúsupport‚Äù abilities like slows and stuns now scale from AP), or a Randuin‚Äôs Omen, Frozen Heart, Banshee‚Äôs Veil if more defensive stats are needed.</p>

<h2 id="wards-are-still-op">Wards are still OP</h2>

<p>With the new limit on 3 wards and a pink per champion, you need to be making sure you not only keep on top of your own warding, but try to <em>nicely</em> suggest your team-mates do the same.</p>

<h2 id="good-luck-have-fun">Good luck, have fun.</h2>

<p>So there‚Äôs a fix-up for the previous post. It‚Äôs a bit mashed up and a lot of things need clarification, but Season 4 is a long way away, and there‚Äôs much more to learn and many more games to play.</p>

<h2 id="one-more-thing-i-made-gold-ii-again">One more thing, I made Gold II (again)!</h2>

<p>Duo queueing with a friend trying to get to Gold, branching out to top lane and AD carry for about 30% of my games (and sometimes winning even those games!), and being more confident in shot-calling has landed me back in Gold II. My aim is to reach Plat by Season 4 placement. Wish me luck!</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been three months since my last blog post, so I thought I‚Äôd post some updates on my life <sup>and excuses for not posting</sup>.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Fbqgtaz.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="what-is-life">What is life</h2>

<ul>
  <li>As of October 29th, I am an official (temporary) employee at a leading supermarket chain (hence the corporate banner colour)</li>
  <li>I hit Gold II at my peak in League of Legends (I‚Äôm currently Gold III due to sucking pretty hard, but I‚Äôm quite pleased with my progress. Next up: Platinum!)</li>
  <li>Third year at University has forced me to hit the ground running, and that‚Äôs been pretty tough so far. But so far, so good.</li>
  <li>I <em>still</em> haven‚Äôt got the new Facebook experience</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="coming-up">Coming up</h2>

<p>In the pipe for the blog: some more bigoted, elitist, views on my climb through the ranks in League (and why how self deprecating I am IRL has helped), some Chemistry/Pharmacy stuff (good excuse for revision), and some more random YouTube embeds from music I think you should listen to‚Äìbecause my taste in music is the <em>correct</em> taste in music.</p>

   <title>Google Play Music All Access: terrible title, terrific service</title>

<p><a href="https://play.google.com/about/music/">Google Play Music All Access</a> may well hold the title for being the worst named product in Google history, but for ¬£7.99 a month with a 30 day free trial it may also well be the best-value product in Google history.</p>

<p>Plugging straight into the app on your Android device, the service turns your device into an all-containing jukebox. Songs and albums can be played on a one off basis or added to your library (or device offline) at the press of a button. The service is also available for use via Google‚Äôs web ‚Äúapp‚Äù on desktops and Chrome devices.</p>

<p>The Radio feature works much like Spotify Radio or Pandora, and is so far proving to be a great music discovery method, with the added benefit of being able to download a local copy of any song you like in case you go through a tunnel or land in North Korea.</p>

<p>Speaking of North Korea, there‚Äôs some great documentaries on visiting the hermit nation by <a href="http://www.vice.com/the-vice-guide-to-travel/vice-guide-to-north-korea-1-of-3">Vice on YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>When I initially did the setup routine and migrated my previous blog to Jekyll, I saw it as a temporary thing while I redeveloped my bespoke blog engine ‚ÄúSquareCMS‚Äù. What I didn‚Äôt anticipate was falling in love with the workflow of, developing for, and writing with <a href="//jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<h2 id="a-geeks-platform">A geeks platform</h2>

<p>Also known as a ‚Äúhackers‚Äù platform, Jekyll really is designed to be tinkered and messed with. Unlike with SquareCMS, I have an easily tinkered with testing environment (my home PC running Ruby) that is (most unlike PHP/MySQL development) easily synced with the running‚Äì‚Äú<em>live</em>‚Äù‚Äìenvironment.</p>

<h2 id="unless-you-need-extra-features-generated-flat-files-are-fine">Unless you need extra features, generated flat files are fine</h2>

<p>‚ÄúCompiled‚Äù in around a second or so on my machine, and uploaded in less than a minute, my entire site is now a group of flat, procedurally generated files. Think about it: do you <em>really</em> need a server-side computer generating the same page for every visitor <strong>every</strong> time they visit? Not especially. I don‚Äôt need plugins, multiple authors, server side management, search; I just need a quick-to-use, quick-to-post-to, easy-to-tinker site, and Jekyll provides it.</p>

   <title>League of Legends: Supporting 101</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/article/2013/07/31/supporting-101/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-31T11:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/article/2013/07/31/supporting-101</id>
    <content type="html"><div class="callout callout-warning">
A lot of information in this post is now out of date due to a massive rework of the support role. It's a good idea to read my <a href="//dg9t.eu/article/2013/11/28/supporting-part-2.html">updated notes</a> once you've blasted through this.
</div>

<iframe width="640" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/oIIxlgcuQRU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="1"> </iframe>

<p>Way back last year when lower jungle camps still spawned at 1:40, and the huge success of the season 2 world finals were just a pipe dream at the back of Tryndamere‚Äôs mind, I bit the bullet and signed up for LoL.</p>

<p>I find it fitting that I joined League the week Lulu was released, because (by my will or otherwise) I‚Äôve found myself time and time again <abbr title="(To play a lot/be the strongest at)">maining</abbr> supports. Keep in mind that I‚Äôm currently climbing the Elo ladder for the first time‚Äìas a person who played with 3-5 friends at a time ranked seemed irrelevant to me‚Äìbut I‚Äôd like to share my thoughts/feelings/insights into the support role.</p>

<h2 id="support-styles">Support styles</h2>

<p>I guess I can categorise a few different support styles in blanket terms, in theory all supports can match all styles:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Safe</strong> ‚Äì Soraka, Sona, Taric, Lulu, Janna</li>
  <li><strong>Gun-ho</strong> ‚Äì Blitzcrank, Thresh, Taric, Leona</li>
  <li><strong>Counter-aggressive</strong> ‚Äì Blitzcrank, Leona, Taric, Thresh, Lulu, Sona (post level 6)</li>
</ul>

<p>Safe supports let your ADC/Marksman farm all day long, with you just popping their mana/hp back to full and stopping any threats with a quick stun, damage reduction spell, or just by having wards and good awareness of when champions are charging an auto attack.</p>

<p>Gun-ho supports grab the enemy marksman (sometimes literally) and try-hard to leave them on a platter for their own marksman to mop-up an easy kill.</p>

<p>Counter-aggressive supports play safe until initiated on, they then turn the tide and become gun-ho themselves.</p>

<h2 id="how2supp0rt">How2supp0rt</h2>

<p>The ‚Äúeasiest‚Äù support champion I could recommend at the moment is Leona. If you‚Äôre <abbr title="Re-climbing the Elo ladder on a second account">smurfing</abbr> and need a champion for every role, buy Leona for support. She‚Äôs seldom banned and easily the strongest support in the game.</p>

<h3 id="runes">Runes</h3>

<p>I swear by Gold runes. They are very expensive though so you don‚Äôt need to necessarily buy them if you‚Äôre smurfing, but if you‚Äôre planning on playing more than one support, I highly recommend you buy Gold Quintessences.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/14fWefZ.png" alt="Example rune page" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Wait, why no Gold yellows?</strong><br />
While gold quintessences give you +3 GP10 (<em>Philo gives you +5/10 as a comparison</em>), nine gold yellows only add +2 GP10, which may sound like a lot, but leaves you missing out on 12 armour which armour yellows could be providing. That‚Äôs the difference between an auto attack killing you, and leaving you with enough health to return to base.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="masteries">Masteries</h3>

<p>I like to go <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YJ9zmye.jpg">1/12/17 for melee supports</a> and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/jLFzwF7.jpg">5/0/25 for ranged</a>, with a completed Utility tree and more cooldown reduction for ranged supports and a slightly sacrificed Utility tree and more defence points for melee (the explanation shouldn‚Äôt be necessary).</p>

<h3 id="playing-leona">Playing Leona</h3>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/AE9oErN.gif" alt="Playing Leona" /></p>

<p>Level Shield of Daybreak (Q), Zenith Blade (E) , Eclipse (W). Max W first followed by Q. Your ‚Äúcombo‚Äù is to activate your Q and W, then E onto the enemy marksman and let things happen. Your ultimate is great at locking down enemies, or slowing/stopping them when they try to run. Remember Solar Flare stuns enemies trapped in the centre, and slows enemies around it.</p>

<h3 id="beating-leona">Beating Leona</h3>

<p>In ranked, counter Leona with champions like Soraka, Lulu, Alistar, and Janna. These heroes all have interrupts, heals and/or shields to disrupt and fix the damage from a Leona.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UbZnDdM.gif" alt="Beating Leona" /></p>

<p>A quick E, W, Q combo can protect your carry from Leona, and deal tonnes of damage in return.</p>

<h2 id="the-support-mindset">The support mindset</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Watching people like Krepo and XPecial and Madlife, you‚Äôd think all support heroes were point-and-click, you‚Äôd never guess from a glance that Thresh, Lulu, Blitzcrank and more all have skillshots.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first biggest misconception I‚Äôve ever seen in League is that ‚Äúsupport is easy‚Äù, and I want to shut that one down straight away. No matter what way you look at it, early game, <abbr title="Formerly ADCs or AD Carries">marksmen</abbr> <strong>suck</strong>. I‚Äôd even go far as saying that early game, the support is <em>stronger</em> than their lane partner. This is highlighted with the fact that when you look at your death recap as a marksman after first blood, you‚Äôll see <em>Leona</em> probably did 50%+ of the total damage, with that pesky Ezreal mopping up with a strategic Q or <abbr title="Auto Attack">AA</abbr>. Now, watching people like Krepo and XPecial and Madlife, you‚Äôd think all support heroes were point-and-click, you‚Äôd never guess from a glance that Thresh, Lulu, Blitzcrank and more all have skillshots. But, no. Support is not easy. As a support you not only have to be a move ahead of your marksman, you have to have wards timed and accounted for, cooldowns stacked in your head, minimap awareness, strong <abbr title="The idea that you make the enemy know you're there by poking and harassing">lane-presence</abbr>, and the mind-set that when it comes to it, you will die for your marksman.</p>

<h3 id="going-1-6-isnt-that-bad">Going 1-6 isn‚Äôt that bad</h3>

<p>Yesterday, I had a game which was a prime example of this. As Thresh, I had a Tristana in my lane who managed to finish laning phase 0-0 with higher farm than the enemy Vayne who was 4-0. The junglers had left bot alone, we had struggled from the start and I conceded first blood. I finished laning phase 0-4. GG, right? Perhaps not. League is a game about pressure, CS, objectives, and <strong>morale</strong>. Laning phase ended, Tristana picked up a shutdown bonus on Vayne and the team picked on her after that, and we shut her down hard. The idea that you if you can sometimes just throw yourself in the way of the marksmans inevitable death isn‚Äôt just a noble afterthought, it‚Äôs a calculated decision. I‚Äôm not saying suicide and go 0-10, far from it, I‚Äôm saying if you dying‚Äìand ‚Äúfeeding‚Äù as our Nidalee so eloquently put it‚Äìkeeps your carry alive and able to outfarm under the tower, it‚Äôs less a ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù and more a ‚Äúcalculation‚Äù.</p>

<p>Your greatest asset as a support is your kit. Learn your Q through R, buy items like Aegis (upgrade it to a Locket), Randuin‚Äôs, Zeke‚Äôs Herald, Twin Shadows, Mikael‚Äôs Crucible etc. Have trouble remembering? Make a custom item set, you want something that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/g1jfTZ7.png" alt="How to support" /></p>

<p>Keep your carry alive, keep yourself alive (unless you need a ‚Äúcalculated death‚Äù), <strong>secure the kills for the team, then your carry</strong>. By that, I mean, only leave a kill if you are certain your carry can lasthit it. If you‚Äôre on Skype or TeamSpeak, great, they‚Äôre going to be telling you straight away if you need to lasthit; on solo queue, it‚Äôs more of a gained skill. As a rule in thumb: when in doubt, just do as much damage as you can, even if it means <em>taking the kill</em>. At the end of the day, assist gold is better than no gold for your carry/jungler/roaming mid/tp‚Äôing top laner.</p>

<h3 id="wards-are-not-an-optional-endeavour">Wards are not an optional endeavour</h3>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hX27BeQ.jpg" alt="Minimum wards" /></p>

<p>The sightstone is an incredible item. If you‚Äôre not building it first you should be building it either directly after your gold item or at the same time as level 1 boots. When you b, always buy a pink and a couple of pots if you can. Mapped above are common locations for wards and smart locations for wards if you‚Äôre on bot lane, top lane can be translated similarly. <strong>Make bottom lane an impenetrable fortress for all but your team</strong>. (<em>NB: if the enemy purple team has a Zac, or Thresh, ward purple side tri bush to stop lantern/jump ganks.</em>)</p>

<h3 id="shield-supports-take-more-skill">Shield supports take more skill</h3>

<p>Yeah, you could be Soraka and just heal your carry back up to full after taking poke, or just sit there dancing as Sona giving your marksman an armour buff, but real men use shields. There is skill involved in noticing when an enemy is moving to auto attack your ally, there is skill involved in landing the shield down. The true secret, is to make your carry think ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt take any damage from that <abbr title="Caitlyn's passive">headshot</abbr>‚Äù. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you need to level your shield though, level one shields suffice on Lulu (Q or W can sometimes be better levelled), Thresh (E &gt; Q &gt; W), or even an aggressive Janna. Just make an early investment in an emblem of valour (just make sure to let your jungler know, else you‚Äôll be buying <abbr title="Banner of command">promote</abbr>).</p>

<h3 id="theres-a-reason-you-get-35g-every-time-you-auto-attack">There‚Äôs a reason you get 3/5G every time you auto attack</h3>

<p>Harass. Poke. Prod. Annoy the hell out of the enemies. Do not just afk in the bush and wait for things to happen (unless that‚Äôs how your carry wants the lane to be played, in which case, disregard their instructions, see above.).</p>

<h2 id="remember-its-a-game">Remember it‚Äôs a game</h2>

<p>If it‚Äôs going badly, don‚Äôt sweat. If you‚Äôre getting flamed, mute them and report them. <strong>Good luck, have fun</strong>.</p>

<p>Call me a sheep but the world appears to be getting flatter, and I for one welcome the change.</p>

<h2 id="something-the-big-three-all-agree-on">Something the big three all agree on</h2>

<p>Apple, Google, and Microsoft have all taken steps towards flat interfaces with the advent of iOS 7, Android 4.0, and Windows 8 respectively, and they‚Äôre not the only ones. Twitter/Github‚Äôs <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, and as such a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/28/bootstrap-3-goes-mobile-first-now-reportedly-powers-1-of-the-web/">claimed 1% of the web, has followed suit</a>.</p>

<p>Pardon me for bandwagon-ing, but I see the pros for this trend and have tweaked by site <strong>again</strong> to follow, like the wool covered animal I am.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-other-changes">A few other changes</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve finally fixed the paddings and spacing of the site, so it no longer hurts your eyes to separate the page, and I‚Äôve now made my desktop and mobile background the header banner, the source is <a href="http://wallbase.cc/wallpaper/2901427">here</a> as well as in the footer. Oh, and I‚Äôve removed the webfonts, just because I watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il4swGfTOSM">this video</a> and took it a little to heart.</p>

<p>&lt;3 you all bbiab, Tom.</p>

<p>I have two notebooks in my possession for ‚Äúcouch computing‚Äù and writing assignments when AFBC (away from behemoth computer). Their specs are rather modest, even for their generations. The larger of the two is a 2007 model 15‚Äù HP laptop sporting an AMD64 2.2GHz Dual Core processor, 2GB RAM and integrated Nvidia graphics with a max resolution of 1280x768, the smaller being a 7‚Äù Asus Eee PC sporting a 0.9GHz Intel 32-bit single core Celeron processor and a whopping 1GB RAM, with Intel ‚Äúaccelerated‚Äù graphics pumping out an impressively crisp 1024x600px resolution. Both these devices are over 5 years old, but let‚Äôs look at phones from 5 years ago: the HTC G1 had a 320x480 pixel display, a 0.528GHz processor (single core) and 192MB RAM, about comparable with computers at the turn of the <em>millennium</em> (although ‚Äúgaming rigs‚Äù may have sported Intel Tualatin‚Äôs clocking 1.2GHz). Flash forward and  my Nexus 4 today has a <strong>quad core</strong> 1.51 GHz Snapdragon, 2GB RAM and a Qualcomm Adreno pumping  out 768x1184 pixels.</p>

<h2 id="the-pointtldr">The point/Tl;dr</h2>

<p>When mid-high range phones have caught up to low-mid range computers from just 5-6 years ago, when 5-6 years ago, they were nearly 10 years behind, you know the future of mobile tech is going to be awesome. (<em>Also, Moore‚Äôs law</em>)</p>

   <title>Pokemon Two Player Nuzlocke Challenge</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/article/2013/06/27/nuzlocke/"/>
   <updated>2013-06-27T10:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/article/2013/06/27/nuzlocke</id>
    <content type="html"><p>My friend Matty and I have decided to run a two-player Nuzlocke challenge with Pokemon Diamond and Pearl.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/6/65/Basic_Nuzlocke_rules.png" alt="The basic rules" title="The basic rules" /></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xISdT3f.png" class="float-left" alt="" /></p>

<p>The rules we are using are adapted from a Red and Blue challenge, so the levels may turn out to be a bit difficult, but who doesn‚Äôt like a challenge?</p>

<p>The first dilemma is our rule-set states you may only have as many <em>active</em> Pokemon as your rival had at your last battle, but Nuzlocke rules state you must ‚Äúcatch the first Pokemon in each area and nothing else‚Äù.</p>

<p>The easiest way around this was to follow the Nuzlocke rules, but box all ‚Äúinactives‚Äù at Gyms and WiFi battles.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qCLxyL9.png" class="float-right" alt="" /></p>

<p>My main issue with the system at the moment, at the early stages of the game, is that mine and Matty‚Äôs teams are <em>very</em> similar, due to the fact that early routes are filled with Bidoof and Starly. That being said, I managed to catch a Magikarp while Matty got an Abra, I got a Shinx while he got an Onix, so hopefully our parties will be diverse and fights won‚Äôt just be pound-offs.</p>

<h2 id="my-party">My Party</h2>

<p><em>All level 10, inactives in italics</em></p>

<p><img src="https://www.pokecheck.org/i/anim/393.gif" alt="" /> Darwin, the Bidoof.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.pokecheck.org/i/anim/403.gif" alt="" /> Sparks, the Shinx.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.pokecheck.org/i/anim/399.gif" alt="" /> <em>Buck, the Bidoof.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://www.pokecheck.org/i/anim/129.gif" alt="" /> <em>Gulp, the Magikarp.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://www.pokecheck.org/i/anim/401.gif" alt="" /> <em>Bugsy, the Kricketot.</em></p>

<h2 id="grinding-is-a-real-grind">Grinding is a real grind</h2>

<p>Getting Pokemon to flat levels is a real bore, especially early game when all wild Pokemon do is use Growl and Growth; I would <em>kill</em> for an exp share.</p>

<h2 id="anyway">Anyway</h2>

<p>I‚Äôll be updating the blog with notes on my (and Matty‚Äôs) progress in the coming days/weeks.</p>

    <content type="html"><h2 id="rss-is-dead-long-live-rss">RSS is dead, long live RSS</h2>

<p>According to Google, I am a <a href="//googlereader.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html">dying statistic</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Äúusage of Google Reader has declined‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My daily routine for the past four or five years has involved checking-in with Google Reader every morning and every evening to catch up on sites that I either don‚Äôt visit (ex. <a href="//daringfireball.net"><em>Daring Fireball</em></a>), or don‚Äôt frequent enough to keep up with their onslaught of posts (ex. <a href="//theverge.com"><em>The Verge</em></a>). To me, RSS is one of the, if not <strong>the</strong>, best Internet technologies invented. It gives me the freedom to procure my own ‚Äútop list‚Äù of sites and read them like an Internet-newspaper digest whenever I please. So imagine my dismay when I see:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/PsyHz5s.png" alt="Ugh..." /></p>

<p>If you haven‚Äôt heard, Google Reader will be ‚ÄúSunsetted‚Äù on July 1st. To Google‚Äôs credit I was able to take away a copy of my OPML subscriptions list, but as I discovered, there‚Äôs few places to go.</p>

<h2 id="google-simultaneously-saved-and-killed-the-rss-reader-market">Google simultaneously saved and killed the RSS reader market</h2>

<p>Initially, I looked at services like Google‚Äôs <a href="//www.google.com/producer/currents">Currents</a>, and <a href="//flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a>; and hated them. My issue with these services is I may as well just be using the content providers websites, as Google Reader has solidly bred me into the camp where I just want a list of headlines from every source ordered chronologically which I can J and K through. I also tried <a href="//feedly.com">Feedly</a> and signed up for Digg‚Äôs <a href="//digg.com/reader">Reader</a>, but Feedly left me feeling overwhelmed with features I didn‚Äôt understand and weren‚Äôt documented, and Digg still haven‚Äôt rolled out their Reader due to what looks like <a href="//www.theverge.com/2013/6/21/4451644/diggs-very-beta-rss-reader-is-it-enough-to-woo-google-reader-users">issues</a> with the service.</p>

<p>There are services like Sean Inman‚Äôs <a href="//feedafever.com">Fever</a> and <a href="//tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki">Tiny Tiny RSS</a>, but both are self-hosted and my current webspace provider doesn‚Äôt allow me to use all the features they require, though running one of them on a RaspberryPi may prove an interesting summer project.</p>

<h2 id="giving-up">Giving up</h2>

<p>Sadly, I did concede in the end and couldn‚Äôt persevere to find a good solution. I uninstalled the Google Reader app from my phone and removed it from the default tabs on Chrome. My information glut has begun.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4nb5s4t.png" alt="Filling the gap" /></p>

<p>My only viable alternative for now has been to install <a href="//news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> and <a href="//reddit.com">Reddit</a> apps, which I try to keep on top of at least 2-3 times a day, but sadly, much like it used to pre-Reader, news and information can just pass me by. (Luckily the big stuff like all the current Snowden malarky stays on the frontpages for long enough for me to pick up on.)</p>

<h2 id="asideor-wheres-my-feedxml-file">Aside‚Äìor ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my feed.xml file?‚Äù</h2>

<p>On the topic of RSS but slightly aside from the main point; yes I am lacking an RSS feed for this site. Rest assured I‚Äôm hacking away at a solution and should be committing it to the Git repo Soon‚Ñ¢.</p>

   <id>http://localhost:4000/article/2013/01/17/finding-the-perfect-writing-tool</id>
    <content type="html"><p>I‚Äôve always enjoyed writing, but I‚Äôve always found myself obsessing over the tool I use more than actually writing. This could mean spending more time trying to find the perfect pen and Moleskine, or more recently, constantly changing the CMS or blogging tool, or even the word processor I use.</p>
<h2 id="distraction-free-writing">Distraction Free Writing</h2>
<p>Markdown has long been a tool I‚Äôve used to write things down in shorthand, and at one stage I used it as the default markup language for my blog posts; but of late I‚Äôve realised it‚Äôs a fantastic way to push <em>distraction free writing</em> upon myself, which focuses on the content you are writing, rather than the implement you use. 
There are a multitude of available ‚ÄúZen writers‚Äù available, several of which include their own soundtracks, which change depending on how fast you are typing (to really get you in the zone). The editor I‚Äôm using at the moment is called ‚ÄúWriter‚Äù and is available on the Google Play Store for Android phones and tablets. While you might think typing essays and blog posts on a phone keyboard could be a chore, I‚Äôve found with Jelly Beans new swipe gesture keyboard my typing is actually faster than I can physically write, the biggest barrier to the speed is how much you trust the software; as I find the more often I check for errors, the slower I go.</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   Ignore the surroundings, focus on the task in front of you
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose if anything, my adventure in finding a better writing tool has led me to realise a few things: the simplest option is often the best, I‚Äôll never be happy with my blogs design, and ignore the surroundings, focus on the task in front of you.</p>

   <title>Subtle Links with CSS</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/note/2012/03/08/subtle-links-with-css/"/>
   <updated>2012-03-08T20:02:51+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/note/2012/03/08/subtle-links-with-css</id>
    <content type="html"><p>I think every time I recreate this blog I end up posting a few little CSS tips that I use constantly, and when I say constantly I mean consistently for over three or so years now.</p>

<p>##Visible Clicks</p>

<p>Most people add a custom colour to <code class="highlighter-rouge">a:links</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">a:hover</code> in their CSS using the latter to show when a user has hovered over a clickable link, but what about when the user actually clicks? For that most old school browsers added a dotted outline to a:active which was all well and good back in the days of 800x600 and Web 1.0, but apparently we‚Äôve moved passed that, with most sites not even employing any form of ‚Äúactive event‚Äù (see Twitter). This can be seen as a bad thing as for people without mouses employing the tab button to navigate a site it then becomes near on impossible to see what link you‚Äôve selected, but I digress. A really subtle touch you can add to links to show a user has clicked is to employ a:active to show a small change to the link; my favourite being:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nt">a</span><span class="nd">:active</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">position</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">relative</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nl">top</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">1px</span><span class="p">;}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You can try that on this null link (click and hold to see the position of the link change slightly). As you‚Äôll be able to see, clicking pushes the entire link down by a single pixel, generating a really subtle ‚Äúpushed in‚Äù effect.</p>

  <p>The eval() language construct is very dangerous because it allows execution of arbitrary PHP code. Its use thus is discouraged. If you have carefully verified that there is no other option than to use this construct, pay special attention not to pass any user provided data into it without properly validating it beforehand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today I got a bit of a coding itch, it ended up in me having an epiphany in the shower of all places as to why in <em>hells</em> name I‚Äôd ever used <code class="highlighter-rouge">eval</code> in making SquareCMS, and how to fix it. After a lot of work this afternoon I‚Äôve managed to rewrite <a href="https://github.com/tomchatting/SquareCMS/blob/master/square/controllers/theme.php">/controllers/theme.php</a> from scratch using functions to output text then displaying that to the user. Originally I did some rather recursive and <em>dangerous</em> stuff (see blockquote from PHP.net) within the theme file, using it to generate another PHP file within itself then using <code class="highlighter-rouge">eval</code> to execute it within theme.php.</p>

<p>theme.php originally had a few functions or different roles. At it‚Äôs simplest, theme.php would always be called by a function using eval in a way such as:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>eval(echo 'themeFunction($file)';)  and would be passed a file in plain text, usually a theme file such as [this](https://github.com/tomchatting/SquareCMS/blob/master/square/themes/default/index.page) one. This file would then be stripped of all its' `&lt;square:tags /&gt;` by using regular expressions or simple find and replace functions, in these tags places would be the raw code required to do what the theme writer wanted to be present, for example `&lt;square:url /&gt;` returns the blogs' URL using the pre-set constant, but returns it as `'.URL.'` so the PHP can be executed (as if you look above the eval call is echoing the output) and leaves the next returned string able to do the same, leaving an even playing field. This file would then be saved to a variable, ready to be eval'd by the calling function.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Eval executes arbitrary PHP code, exactly as it would run as if you‚Äôd called it from the web browser or included it from another file; so it runs with the same privileges as such a file would if it were uploaded via FTP and executed. This produces an inherent problem particularly with something like a blog engine such as the one I made, not because you can generate execution issues (this is true, debugging with eval is much, much harder as I discovered) but because when you begin introducing user generated content like themes and plugins; security becomes a huge issue.</p>

<h2 id="trust-no-one">Trust No-One</h2>

<p>Herein lies the problem: if you allow a user to begin adding non-verified and non-tested components to your software, is it right to allow them to operate at the same execution level as the verified and tested components? Of course not, that‚Äôs suicide. If a malicious user were to set up a file or plugin that put the users server, or worse their <em>data</em> at risk, it wouldn‚Äôt be the fault of the user for installing such a component, nor would it be the malicious guy (well, it would, but that‚Äôs not the point) it‚Äôd be the jack-ass that allowed for this sort of stuff to happen in the first place.</p>

<p>So before anything like this was able to happen to anyone that may use/fork Square in the future, I decided to completely remove all evals from SquareCMS, and as of tomorrow on GitHub the code this server is running will be pushed into the Repo for review/proof.</p>

<h2 id="simple-take-out">Simple take-out</h2>

<p>The main conclusion to gain from this article/apology is not that you should never use evals, they can be quite useful for a variety of reasons, and in some cases they are the only solution to a problem; but you <strong>have</strong> to be 110% sure that all parameters are both correct (to save difficult debugging) and trusted, and in the case of third-party solutions being added to your project, you can guarantee neither, so a different option is often the better one.</p>

<p>For what it‚Äôs worth, it turns out SquareCMS runs around 0.01 seconds <em>slower</em> now it doesn‚Äôt run evals to parse themes, as it has to parse files two or three times separately due to the nature of how I construct pages from files, though I‚Äôm sure I can shave that back off down the road when I get my next itch.</p>
