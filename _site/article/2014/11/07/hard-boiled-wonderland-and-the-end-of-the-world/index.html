<p>In my quest to invest myself more heavily in Japanese culture (beyond Japanese game shows and manga) I decided to plunge into the world of Japanese literature. After much thought and blurb-reading, I happened upon <em>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</em> by Haruki Murakami. The author, speculated to have been shortlisted for the Nobel Prize for Literature multiple times, is said to be ‚Äúpoetic‚Äù in his writing style; easy to read, yet thought-provoking and impactful. I was told to expect a mix of ‚Äúwestern-style fantasy‚Äù and ‚Äúscience-fiction mystery‚Äù, and boy, does Murakami deliver.</p>

<p>The novel follows two narratives which standalone and later intertwine: <em>Hard-Boiled Wonderland</em> tells the story of a successful corporate/government agent, dutifully fulfilling his set tasks whilst enjoying an almost pragmatic lifestyle, in a tone not dissimilar to the narrators in <em>The Humans</em> or <em>The Curious Tale</em>. <em>The End of the World</em> tells the tale of a lost soul, who departs with his shadow to gain entry to a town at the end of the world. He is given the task of ‚Äúdream reading‚Äù until such a time his shadow dies, and he can become immortal and ‚Äúat one‚Äù with the town which protects him from the outside world that all within strive to forget.</p>

<p>The pure beauty of Murakami‚Äôs writing is that even within the translation, subtleties creep in. It took me half a dozen chapters (and a re-read of two) to realise the author never actually divulges the name of a single character, yet his writing style and descriptive narrative leave me questioning whether a name is ever needed. The author also switches between the personal past tense and present tense in alternate chapters in such a subtle way, leaving a strong satisfaction as you try to puzzle the ending together.</p>

<p>A fascinating mystery science-fiction adventure with an ending that leaves you to think. <em>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</em> is a fantastic introduction to an obviously strong writer and, as my new copy of <em>A Wild Sheep Chase</em> suggests, is a great gateway novel to more of the same.</p>

<p>‚ô¶ 4.5/5</p>
