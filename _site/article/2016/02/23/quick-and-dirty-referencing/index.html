    <h1>quick and dirty referencing 🖊</h1>
    <summary></summary>
    <p>One lesson all uni students should have in their schedules every year is a
lecture from the librarian of their school. In my case that was a recently
graduated Humanities student (because who else would be the Sciences librarian?)
who would give us the same talk every year on the importance of referencing.</p>

<p>Though boring as hell, I didn’t realise how lucky I was to receive something like
this so consistently during my years at uni; it was only after I discovered
my sister was never taught to reference.</p>

<h1 id="turn-it-in-and-you-and-the-devil-too">turn it in and you (and the devil, too!)</h1>

<p>All universities in this day and age use some sort of plagiarism ‘detecting’
tool such as turnitin to sort the cheats from the heroes. Most of these
are terrible, terrible pieces of pseudo-ware which simply plug your work
through Google et al to try and work out if you just copy-pasted Wikipedia.</p>

<p>To combat this, the primary school child in you will automatically begin
rewriting what you are copying into your own words, but this is where the basic
rule of academic writing steps in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if you write anything which cannot be considered your own thought or idea, it <strong>must</strong> be referenced (Chatting, 2016)</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="building-references">building references</h1>

<p>Wherever possible, you should compile a list of the sources you use for each
page of your writing (<em>just stick it in the footer</em>) so you can go back once
it’s finished so you can build your bibliography (which I’ll touch on later).</p>

<p>For books, grab the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>author’s name(s)</li>
  <li>year of publication</li>
  <li>book title</li>
  <li>edition (if not the 1st)</li>
  <li>city of publication</li>
  <li>publisher</li>
</ul>

<p>For journal articles, you’ll need the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>author’s name(s)</li>
  <li>year the journal was published</li>
  <li>title of the article</li>
  <li>title of the journal</li>
  <li>the page number or range of pages of the article</li>
  <li>volume and issue numbers where you can provide them</li>
</ul>

<p>For ‘electronic resources’, try to get the above plus the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>date you accessed the sources</li>
  <li>the URL or email</li>
  <li>type of resource (email, forum, website, etc)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="quotes-vs-interpretation">quotes vs interpretation</h1>

<p>If you ever use the idea of another person or quote someone (which you should
keep to a bare minimum) you should be looking to add a reference. You can get
away with not using a reference <strong>only</strong> when the information can be considered
public domain, for example stating that the 6’o’clock News generally airs at 6pm.</p>

<h2 id="direct-quotes">direct quotes</h2>

<p>If you ever copy what an author says word-for-word, use inverted commas or
double inverted commas to wrap the phrase and follow it immediately with your
reference. Do not modify the sentence in anyway, leaving mistakes as they are.
You can correct any errors and show your reader you recognise them by using <em>(sic)</em>.</p>

<h2 id="referencing-interpretation">referencing interpretation</h2>

<p>This is how you should be completing the majority of your academic writing, as
it is a true display of your understanding of a topic. You must still reference
the ideas, and this is done by quoting the author’s surname and the year of
publication in brackets.</p>

<h1 id="referencing-the-actual-way-to-do-it">referencing (the actual way to do it)</h1>

<p>Harvard referencing can be broken down into two parts: the article’s body, and
the reference list.</p>

<p>The article body points at the reference list using the author’s surname and
date, which is then displayed in full with the source used in the reference
list, for example if I were to say: referencing is a fking ballache.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chatting (2016) suggests referencing is a tedious process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Summarises the gist of what I said, whereas a direct quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chatting (2016) stated ‘referencing is a fking(sic) ballache’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Referencing a journal or book might look like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>F. D. Martinez, 2007. “Genes, environments, development and asthma: a reappraisal” doi: 10.1183/​09031936.00087906ERJ January 1, 2007 vol. 29 1 179-184</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While referencing this website may look like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chatting, T (2016) ‘quick and dirty referencing’, <em>tom</em> [Online], Available: <a href="http://tomchatting.github.io/article/2016/02/23/quick-and-dirty-referencing.html">http://tomchatting.github.io/article/2016/02/23/quick-and-dirty-referencing.html</a> [23 Feb 2016]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your reference list should be organised in alphabetical order (by author’s surname)
or in logical order (the order in which you referenced them in the body).</p>

<h2 id="let-your-references-run-free">let your references run free</h2>

<p>The tl;dr of all this is please reference or you will fail/have an academic
integrity review and that will be a bad thing. There is no ‘good’ number of
references to aim for, but there is no such thing as too many references.</p>

<p>Layout and some examples taken from the University of Exeter’s Study Skills guide
to referencing found <a href="https://education.exeter.ac.uk/dll/studyskills/harvard_referencing.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>A fantastic tool for creating reference guides/bibliographies is <a href="http://www.neilstoolbox.com/bibliography-creator/">Neil’s Toolbox</a>, to which I would
like to credit my entire degree.</p>
