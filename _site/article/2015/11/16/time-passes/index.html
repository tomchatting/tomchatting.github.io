<p>But this isn’t art, it’s a release. Or is a release a kind of art?</p>

<p>Since May, I can’t think of a massive amount in my life that has changed, but a
lot of minor things can be reeled off the top of my head which I think add up
to a fairly huge change.</p>

<h2 id="i-now-own-my-first-and-only-pair-of-tracksuit-bottoms">I now own my first and only pair of tracksuit bottoms</h2>

<p>I’ve left the phase of my life where I’d revolve around the PC: bed, PC; work,
PC; home, PC; eat, PC; bed.</p>

<p>In a quest to free myself from the chair and desk, I bought a MacBook Air and a
Kindle; using the money from an accolade at work to fund several books. I burned
 through the books and used the MacBook as an ASMR machine. I bought loose
fitting tracksuit bottoms and plain-cotton tees. I wrote a lot of letters to
people which I’d never deliver. I culled my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/tomchatting/playlist/06BE3SX9j3lDJVSdaHCgRh">Spotify playlist</a> and started
again. But I always find a way to relapse, even if slightly. I write this post
after a week of computer-slump. I have neglected the MacBook, left the Kindle
in deep sleep, and reverted my Spotify playlist. Maybe people can’t change.</p>

<p>I remember when I once idolised a friend (and part-time lover), and I could
never understand their obsession with ‘making a change’, pledging every other
month that they’d finally break their mould and get a full-time lover, a
fulfilling job, move out of the house. It seemingly never happened, until the
proactivity from a new interest ended up in everything falling into place.
They’re getting married now, fuck, even having a kid; and yet here I lay, still
pledging to not committing until I’m ready, still ultimately alone.</p>

<h2 id="dont-take-for-granted-one-you-can-confide-in-because-once-theyre-gone-theres-no-lonelier-place">Don’t take for granted one you can confide in, because once they’re gone there’s no lonelier place</h2>

<p>Although I count myself lucky enough to have three close (<em>best</em>) friends, I
find myself no longer having someone I can tell <em>everything</em>. My idol was the
one I would share everything with, and they reciprocated. Although at the time
it felt very natural and familiar, now they’re gone there’s a crippling
loneliness that could almost be mistaken for sadness. But it’s not: it’s real
life.</p>

<h2 id="ultimately-i-may-have-inadvertently-done-a-lot-of-growing-up-over-the-past-12-months">Ultimately I may have inadvertently done a lot of growing up over the past 12 months</h2>

<p>It’s my 12 months anniversary of starting my job at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Big Red Bank</code>. I’ve
never missed a day, I’ve never been later than 30 minutes early. Head down,
full-charge. Every. Damn. Day. I look back at myself 12 months ago and see
a much shyer, reclusive young man. Working at a call centre has a very important
 early lesson: talk spreads. That includes information about myself. Some people
 embrace me, others do not. But ultimately the difference between now Tom and
then Tom is: I simply don’t care.</p>

<p>So where does this leave the next 12 months? I still have short-term goals. But
I’m looking much more long-term than I ever have before. I want to learn more
culture, I want to develop my vocabulary, I want to try new food. Maybe I’ll
fall into the same slump as before (again even if only slightly), or maybe I’ll
manage just enough of a change to nudge myself into another New Tom. Future Tom.
 I hope he looks back at this release and cringes.</p>
