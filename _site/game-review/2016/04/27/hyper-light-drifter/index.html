  <time datetime='2016-04-27'>27 Apr 2016</time>
<p>Having now dabbled in the <em>Souls</em> series I can say with certainty that I am a
masochist.</p>

<p>Hyper Light Drifter appeared on my Steam queue as a game it thought I would like
 (<em>as Steam does</em>). After reading the reviews and watching a couple of the
videos, I was sold. 30 minutes later I was hooked.</p>

<h2 id="okay-ill-try-one-more-time-then-im-going-to-bed">â€˜okay, iâ€™ll try one more time then iâ€™m going to bedâ€™</h2>

<p>Hyper Light Drifter is a game aboutâ€¦ wellâ€¦ I donâ€™t really know. The only
backstory you get is from the odd cutscene which is backed by the gameâ€™s
incredible soundtrack. The cutscenes are not spoken. There are no subtitles.
The only â€˜languageâ€™ is the odd grunt from NPCs. So far all I can tell is the PC
has some sort of illness that makes him periodically cough up blood, and some
friendly fella took him to a central city. From this central city you are free
to tackle the game in any direction you like. From what I have begun to gather
from the game the objective is to dungeon crawl four areas which piece together
fourâ€¦ things. These things seem to be the focal point of the game. I have
encountered a couple of NPCs who have tried to distract me with what looks
like optional boss rooms, but Iâ€™m not too sure yet (Iâ€™m only 30-40% through the
game).</p>

<p>The gameâ€™s central mechanic revolves around timing. This game is <em>fucking hard</em>.
You are given 5 hit points (which I am yet to find a way to increase), and the
game is lightly littered with HP boosters (which get you from any health to max).
But itâ€™s not about hit points or healingâ€“itâ€™s about getting it fucking right.</p>

<p>The PC has three real moves (more if you collect the games rare â€˜currencyâ€™).
A hack/slash, a gun which recharges bullets from hacking/slashing and your
bread and butter: a dash which can be used three times in quick succession.
Each game area usually has an exploration area, followed by some warm up creatures
unique to that area. Then there is a â€˜boss roomâ€™ which throws everything at you
at once. After a succession of deaths you slowly learn the
areaâ€™s pattern, you change your style, you become more patient. You <em>become</em> a
ninja. This game does not allow a simple -run in hack slash spam A- approach, in
fact, it <em>punishes</em> it; and when you finally get that checkpoint and quadrant,
holy fuck does it feel rewarding.</p>

<h1 id="you-could-legit-gfycat-any-scene-in-this-game">you could legit gfycat any scene in this game</h1>

<p>This game is downright beautiful. Itâ€™s ambiance is created by the amazing
backdrop and colours, combined with itâ€™s sombre soundtrack, which slowly builds
up from the melodic piano in the safe habour central city up to the rhythmic
dungeon crawling soundtrack (which really gets me in the zone). Occasionally
the game feels fairly <em>wtf</em>, particularly with itâ€™s non-language cryptic
backstory and random blood-coughing moments, but on the whole Hyper Light Drifter
feels like a game that should cost more than itâ€™s Â£15.99 price tag.</p>
