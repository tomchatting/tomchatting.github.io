<p>As I alluded to in a previous rant, I have the unnatural talent of allowing myself into slumping. By this I mean I can be quite content in the art of settling. I’m coming up to the two-year mark at <em>big red bank</em>, and until very recently I was reaching a similar position I was in this time last year: complacency.</p>

<p>In my last month’s career conversation my manager hit the nail on the head; I am happy to silently pay my dues, get on with the work and take no recognition for it. I hit &gt;90% of my performance indicators, I cause little to no drama and I don’t like to draw any attention to myself. She continued that she fears I will become bored in my role, so she offered I become an SME in a new focus for the bank: digital opportunities, in order to give me something new to do. Alongside this she suggested I keep an open mind about “progression”, to which I agreed. Later that day I applied for a manager job. Not even four days later I’m told I have a preliminary interview on Monday.</p>

<p>I don’t necessarily think I’ll even pass the prelim stage, hell I’m surprised my <cite>written in thirty minutes oh Dog I sent it before even proof-reading it</cite> cover letter even got me this far; but so far my Saturday has been spent swatting up on policies and procedures a manager undertakes ready for a roleplay and a presentation. Oh boy.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-else-is-new">so what else is new?</h2>

<p>I bought myself a Ducky One keyboard, partly because I quite fancy taking up writing (be it notes, blogs, reviews, stories I’ll never publish) and the Ducky is renowned for being a delight to type on—which it is—but also because CLACK CLACK. The sound of a fully mechanical, cherry switched keyboard is just downright… pleasurable to type on (see attached YouTube video for evidence).</p>

<p>After a few months of owning a PS4 and a PS Vita I’ve established a fairly healthy amount of games to play through. I recently completed played through <em>Uncharted 4, Until Dawn, Ratchet and Clank, Rogue Warrior, Hyper Light Drifter, NBA 2k16</em> and <em>The Last of Us</em>, thanks to PlayStation Plus however, the list doesn’t go down at any scary speed. I still have <em>Dragon Age, Uncharted: Golden Abyss, Gravity Falls, Life is Strange</em> and <em>Persona 4</em> to chug through, I might even hit this shit up with some notes or a review about them. All the while I’m mid-Gold on <em>League of Legends</em>, though with the shake up in the ranked queue system I really don’t know if I can get carried to Platinum again like last season, but y’know.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-the-plan">so what’s the plan?</h2>

<p>Lawyer up, hit the gym, delete Facebook. Seriously though I have no idea, <em>voice in my head</em>, I can see myself going in a few different directions and to be honest I kind of like the idea of all of them. Hopefully I learn enough from failing my assessment on Monday to get a shoe onto the ladder, if not: I have things lined up still, I’m happy enough where I am, albeit I would love to move out (big up the rental market); but that takes money. Money I keep spending on Ducky keyboards and every games console going. Adulting is easy, right?</p>

<p>And oh yeah, <em>Pokémon Go</em> is a thing.</p>
