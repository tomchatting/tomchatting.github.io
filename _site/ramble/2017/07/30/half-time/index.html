Thereâ€™s been a few times this year Iâ€™ve half-started a post and then just kind of left itâ€“and thatâ€™s okay! Hereâ€™s some of my accomplishments so far this year. (<em>Suck it, 2017</em>)</h3>

<hr />

<p>Time flies.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the year <a href="/2017/01/01/my-annual-year">I looked back at 2016</a> and took stock on what had been happening so far (TL;DR: time moves pretty quick). Flash forward to July and Iâ€™ve realised I have neglected this blog. I also realised that doesnâ€™t really matter.</p>

<h2 id="reflection-is-a-powerful-tool">reflection is a powerful tool</h2>

<p>In January I took a lot of time reflecting before writing my post, this was a very powerful thing to do. For one: it put a lot of things into perspective; huge problems seemed tiny in hindsight, secondly, it allowed me to put a lot of what Iâ€™d done into wordsâ€“and that had a really huge impact. Sometimes accomplishments are drowned out by the problems of the time, problems that seem insignificant in the long run.</p>

<p>2017 has been a very good year so far. Donâ€™t get me wrong, thereâ€™s been the usual fair share of good days and shit days, but Iâ€™m finally starting to maintain a sense of purpose through it all (25 years late, mind).</p>

<h2 id="i-am-still-in-love-with-snapchat">i am still in love with snapchat</h2>

<p>I mentioned last time that I had managed to shake my perpetual social network anxiety, scrolling back through Photos.app shows that hasnâ€™t changed. This has the benefit of me being able to take small amounts of time just scroll through my photos and reminisce over when stuff goes right.</p>

<h2 id="promises-promises">promises promises</h2>

<p>Gonna try to update this blog a little more regularly for the rest of the year. I also want to have a go at a video of some kind (waiting on Josh to let me use his drone). Also, I got an Apple Watchâ€¦ Iâ€™m sorry.</p>
