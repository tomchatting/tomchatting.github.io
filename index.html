  <h1>Thomas Chatting makes stuff</h1>

  <p class=lede>
    👋, my name is Thomas and I'm a girl dad, Business Intelligence (and Full-Stack) developer, and all round IT professional. 
    I'm currently working in the public sector in Data Warehousing. 
    I can usually be found creating solutions in various SQL languages or creating modern front-ends for our internal stakeholders.
    I can be found on Twitter as <a href=https://twitter.com/_tomch target=_blank>@_tomch</a>, 
    <a href=https://github.com/tomchatting>GitHub</a>, 
    <a href=https://linkedin.com/in/thomas-chatting>LinkedIn</a>, 
    and <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@tommm">Mastodon</a> (infrequently).

  <p>This site is hosted on <a href=https://pages.github.com>GitHub pages</a> using <a href=https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll>Jekyll</a>, and most of the content is written in John Gruber's <a href=https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>Markdown</a>.</p>

  <p>The code for this site and all of the posts in raw format can be poked around with on its <a href=https://github.com/tomchatting/tomchatting.github.io>GitHub Repository</a>, but please don't steal (my) stuff.</p>
