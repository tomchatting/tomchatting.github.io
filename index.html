    <p>I am an ASP.NET Software Developer working in the Public Sector in the United Kingdom. I build and maintain 
      full-stack websites that enable people to do important stuff. I've been around the internet for a while, but 
      I generally use it in read-only mode.
    </p>
    <p>I can't remember when I built my first website, but the WayBack Machine has evidence of a blog written by me 
      (written in both senses of the word, <em>thanks PHP</em>) in 2009.</p>
    <p>This website is way less dynamic. I'd go as far as saying it's pretty static (static in both senses of the 
      word, <em>thanks, undiagnosed ADHD</em>), as it's created with Jeykll and GitHub Actions.</p>
