<p>ðŸ‘‹, my name is Thomas. I am a 29 year old NHS colleague from Leeds, currently living <em>not in Leeds</em>. I have been blogging on and off for over 15 years but, fortunately for me, I only have blog posts going back 9 years.</p>

<p>I have recently moved my website back to being hosted on <a href=//github.com/tomchatting/tomchatting.github.io target=_blank>GitHub</a>, and I currently maintain it using a mid-2010 unibody MacBook because my actual laptop is now a <em>Sims 4</em> machine.</p>

<ul class=posts>
{% for post in site.posts %}
  <li>
    <a href={% if post.link %}{{ post.link }}{% else %}{{ post.url }}{% endif %}>{{ post.title }}</a> <time datetime='{{ post.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}'>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
