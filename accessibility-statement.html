    <h2 id="how-you-should-be-able-to-use-this-website">How you should be able to use this website</h2>

    <p>I want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

    <ul>
        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using a keyboard or speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and
            VoiceOver)</li>
        <li>I try to make the website text as simple as possible to understand.</li>
    </ul>
