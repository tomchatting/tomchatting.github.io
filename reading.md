<h1 class="page-top">reading 📚</h1>

<p>This year I've made an effort to try and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyUVgcsjp8s">read more books</a>. I joined a book club at work and I bought quite a few books when I left my last job, thanks to a really generous Amazon gift voucher. I've only just, in September 2022, decided to document this in the table below; so there may well be gaps while I work backwards through my reading list.</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th><abbr title="date started">📅</abbr></th>
        <th>title</th>
        <th>author</th>
        <th><abbr title=completion>?</attr></th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>2022-09-19</td>
        <td>never let me go</td>
        <td>kazuo ishiguro</td>
        <td>🟢</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>2022-08-27</td>
        <td>the joy of small things <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Joy-Small-Things-not-so-small-itself/dp/1783352361">🔗</a></td>
