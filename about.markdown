<h1 class="article-title">hello, world!</h1>

My name's Tom, and I'm a 24 year old working at one of the UK's biggest banks.

## tom

As a kid, I remember we had a family DOS box but I can't remember much of that. The first family PC I remember was a custom OEM built Windows 98SE box in coral blue, which we had from when I was about 7 up until just before high school, when we upgraded the machine and stuck with Windows XP until I got my own laptop running Windows Vista. Since then, I've just build my own PC's but sometimes you can see me hipstering out with my MacBook Air.

Phone wise I've gone from an Android G1 to an iPhone and back... then back again. I currently rock an iPhone 5s, like the filthy hypocrite I am.
