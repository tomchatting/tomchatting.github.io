<h1 class="article-title">hello, world!</h1>

My name is Tom. I am 29 years old and I work for the NHS.

## tom

My earliest computer memory was of my family DOS box but I can't remember much of that. The first family PC I remember was a custom OEM built Windows 98SE box in coral blue, which we had from when I was about 7 up until just before high school when we upgraded the machine and stuck with Windows XP until I got my own laptop running Windows Vista. Since then, I've just built my own PCs but sometimes you can see me hipstering out with my MacBook Pro.

Phone wise I've gone from an Android G1 to an iPhone and back... then back again... then *back again*. I currently rock an iPhone SE 2020, because I have a pretty amazing partner.
