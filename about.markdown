# About Me

## Thomas Chatting

<img src="/img/mugshot.png" class="mugshot float-left" height="100px" />

Hello, world, my name is Thomas Chatting and I am a 21 year old full-time Pharmacy student studying in Huddersfield, UK.

My web "aliases" (if you can call them that) that I can reel off the top of my head are:
* tomchatting
* iglootom
* RxTom
* PhenomenonTom
* Spoolio

Originally from Leeds my lifelong hobby and passion is technology. Ranging from being the first person in my class at college to own an Android phone (the G1, no less) to owning and running some sort of webspace since around 2004, and generally being the go-to tech support guy for my friends and family--and if they're reading this, turn it off and on again, call me on Skype (in that order)--my passions in technology are wide and varied.

From speccing and building modern PCs to meddling with Windows system files, and now--more recently--trying to develop various applications for Windows, Web, and mobile (some of which you can see on [Github][github]; my spare time is generally filled with attempts to make myself productive while doing something I enjoy.

## Early "Work"

Back in High School due to the fact ICT staff became fed-up with me, I was moved into a room more lovingly known as the "IT Cupboard", where the technicians taught me HTML, Windows Server basics, and that being a complete computer nerd was cool and came with perks like Subway platters. Most of their teachings went into circumventing the school firewall to allow me and my friends access to online games during classes, bouncing from free-domain-host to free-domain-host to avoid the blocks--but in the long run taught me a lot about the basics of programming, server running, and page development, leading me to be comfortable with HTML, CSS, JS, and more recently after college, PHP, Ruby, Python, .Net, and Java.
