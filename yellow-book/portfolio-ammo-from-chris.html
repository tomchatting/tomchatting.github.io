                I had a pharmacist ring my Dr when I was prescribed Ondanzetron<br>
                They knew I didnt have cancer or on Chemo<br>
                so was confused by it<br>
                I had a chronic vomiting issue<br>
                No anti-emetics were helping<br>
                As you prob know Ondanzetron is prescribed to chemo patients to<br>
                help them with sickness<br>
                Its quite potent apparently as an anti-emetic<br>
                It didnt help though<br>
                I could probably even tell you the anti-emetics<br>
                I think Metoclopramide was one<br>
                One of them he prescribed alone<br>
                failed<br>
                Doubled the strength and gave with another<br>
                failed<br>
                gave Ondanzetron<br>
                failed<br>
                Domperidone<br>
                I was told though, that as it being possibly part of the problem<br>
                My stomach is producing a little too much acid (Gastroenteroduodenoscopy)
