        <h1>Research project</h1>
        
        <p>
            Aim of research profect is basically to find a potent cytotoxin (~0.1-1µm&lt;IC<sub>50</sub>) that can 
            be sold to Pharma for big <em>cash money</em>.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Synthesis of cytotoxic amides</h2>
        
        <p>
            Study by Dr Moran last year on three compounds found in pepper plant (<em>Piper</em>) found cytotoxicity 
            at 50-100µm&lt;IC<sub>50</sub>, so we want to make 10 or so analogues using/adding groups we <em>know</em> 
            &ldquo;add&rdquo; cytotoxicity, as well as trying some we don't know.
        </p>

        <p>
            The overall role/importance of generating potent molecules will be their role in antibacterial and
            antitumour (more important) activity.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The Moran Group has developed a two-step synthesis to generate isopiperolin B, but yield is &lt;37% and 
            may need work. The briefing sheet shows the cytotoxic activity of isopiperolin B and some of its' analogues, 
            but only the original compound shows high<sup><a href="#1-1">[1]</a></sup> (30µm &lt; IC<sub>50</sub> &lt; 
            100µm) potency.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Piperine gives anther direction for this study, to which we could generate 7-8 analogues of; adding/removing:
            ketones, COH, amides, 5/6 membered rings.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As this is a &ldquo;back burner&rdquo; project as far as the biolab is concerned (for testing), the 
            lab would require 2-4 weeks to test cytotoxicity. Bear in mind the research lab may only be free 
            Wednesdays and Fridays, but undergrad labs in the X building could be used (research lab is on W1).
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Wes would have preferred me starting lab work immediately due to turnaround of cell tests but the 
            lit review is scheduled for this month &ldquo;probably Conway's preference&rdquo;.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The papers he has sent me are <em>not</em> everything I need and I should find my own papers, 
            especially if related to Pharmacy.
