        <h2>Mixture of walk-in fractures from A&amp;E and patients Mr Parker has operated on.</h2>
        
        <h3>Patient 1&mdash;26 y/o male, football injury to shoulder</h3>

            Partial dislocation, heals over time but would need rest.  Noted how the consultant asked about thje day job to see if sick 
            leave was needed. Offered surgery but stressed it was not aboslutely necessary. Referral in a month.
        </p>
                
        <h3 class="clear">General prinicples in fractures</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Position</li>
            <li>Rest</li>
            <li>Rehab</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><em>A sort of fracture's food chain:</em></p>
        
        <p>A&amp;E &rarr; Clinic &rarr; (<em>Surgery</em> &rarr;) Rehab &mdash;<em>discharge can happen at any point</em></p>

        <p>Mr Parker admits that a lot of this is not exactly pharmacy oriented since they don't do much prescribing.</p>
        
        <p><strong>But:</strong> think about a <em>staged care plan</em>, what would most P<sub>x</sub>s be put on in normality?</p>
        
        <p>Probably NSAIDs, analgesics, aspirin, morphine(?).</p>
        
        <p>Primarily, Mr Parker's work is all about keeping movement to a minimum so bones can heal naturally. Surgery considerations: 
        success rate, scarring, complications.</p>
        
        <h3>Patient 2&mdash;76 y/o male, arthritis in knee</h3>
