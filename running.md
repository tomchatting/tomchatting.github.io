<h1 class="page-top">running 🏃</h1>

<p>Last year I took up running in a semi-serious capacity. I've since run the Bradford Race for Life (5 km), and the Leeds Run for All (10 km). I'm planning on buying the HealthKit exporter app that DC Rainmaker on YouTube is constantly recommending, and once I do I will start populating this page with some of the more interesting stats in my effort to improve my race time - I am a Business Intelligence developer, after all.</p>
