    <h1 class="page-top">running 🏃</h1>

    <p>In 2021 I took up running in a semi-serious capacity. I've since run the Bradford Race for Life (5 km), and the Leeds Run for All (10 km). I've bought the HealthKit exporter app that DC Rainmaker on YouTube is constantly recommending, and I'll soon be populating this page with some more interesting stats on my runs - I am a Business Intelligence developer, after all.</p>
